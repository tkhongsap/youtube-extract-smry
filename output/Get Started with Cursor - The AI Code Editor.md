| 00:00 | if you're a developer then you probably |
| 00:01 | cannot get around the cursor ID right |
| 00:04 | now for me it's been popping up |
| 00:06 | everywhere and last week I officially |
| 00:08 | made the switch to make this my main |
| 00:10 | code editor coming from fi code for the |
| 00:12 | past 5 years in this video I will share |
| 00:15 | everything that you need to know so |
| 00:17 | cursor is a fork of fiasco so that is |
| 00:20 | very important to understand so if you |
| 00:22 | are already familiar with using fiest |
| 00:24 | Code the switch is going to be very |
| 00:26 | natural if you're new to fi code or |
| 00:29 | cursor then it might require some setup |
| 00:31 | on your end which we will get into so it |
| 00:34 | basically adds a whole lot of powerful |
| 00:37 | AI features to the FES code that you |
| 00:40 | already know and love where the main |
| 00:42 | features are autocomplete inline edits |
| 00:45 | chat and the composer we're going to |
| 00:48 | cover all of these features in this |
| 00:50 | video to ultimately let you decide |
| 00:53 | whether you want to give this awesome |
| 00:55 | IDE a try so in order to get started you |
| 00:58 | first need to download any install |
| 01:00 | cursor go to the website download it |
| 01:03 | then if you are already using fiest Code |
| 01:06 | you can simply migrate so they have a |
| 01:09 | very easy onboarding experience where if |
| 01:12 | you open up cursor for the first time it |
| 01:15 | asks you to migrate so this is these are |
| 01:17 | going to be your themes your key |
| 01:19 | bindings your extensions and for me this |
| 01:21 | was literally like a one-click setup and |
| 01:24 | I was in an environment that was already |
| 01:26 | familiar for for me with all my |
| 01:28 | shortcuts and extensions as well so this |
| 01:31 | is a really good feature that they have |
| 01:33 | introduced there then once you have |
| 01:35 | everything set up you can open up your |
| 01:37 | cursor IDE and check some specific |
| 01:39 | settings so you can see this is cursor |
| 01:42 | it's a demo project it's very similar to |
| 01:44 | fiest code and here top of the file you |
| 01:47 | cannot see that probably right now but |
| 01:48 | here is cursor you can go to settings |
| 01:50 | and then to cursor settings here you can |
| 01:53 | get into the general settings the models |
| 01:56 | some of the features which we will cover |
| 01:58 | some of them in a bit but out of the box |
| 02:01 | it already comes preconfigured quite |
| 02:04 | well now one important thing to note on |
| 02:07 | pricing is that you can get started with |
| 02:09 | the twoe free plan so everyone can try |
| 02:12 | this but afterwards you have to upgrade |
| 02:14 | to the Pro Plan um which is if you're |
| 02:16 | going to use it probably what's |
| 02:18 | recommended because you have all the |
| 02:19 | features and also all the models that |
| 02:21 | you want to use so you don't even have |
| 02:24 | to plug in your own API Keys you have a |
| 02:26 | single subscription over here but of |
| 02:28 | course this backs the question here's |
| 02:31 | another $20 per month um subscription |
| 02:34 | for an AI tool I personally got CET GPT |
| 02:38 | entropic giup co-pilot now cursor so you |
| 02:42 | really with all of these new AI tools |
| 02:44 | you really have to decide is it really |
| 02:47 | worth the money um for me this is a |
| 02:49 | definite yes so let's get into why I |
| 02:52 | think that is the case and in order to |
| 02:54 | demonstrate these cool AI features I'm |
| 02:56 | going to start with an empty project |
| 02:58 | right here now I have a python |
| 02:59 | background so I'm going to be sharing |
| 03:01 | some code examples within python but you |
| 03:03 | can do this with any programming |
| 03:04 | language but we're going to start blank |
| 03:06 | and I'm going to ask the AI to help us |
| 03:09 | generate examples so I have no idea |
| 03:11 | where this is going but I also want to |
| 03:13 | show you the iterative iterative way to |
| 03:16 | work with these AI tools to move your |
| 03:18 | codebase forward now quick note before |
| 03:20 | we dive into the examples a lot of the |
| 03:23 | settings and things that you will see |
| 03:25 | within my environment are already part |
| 03:27 | of Fes code not cursor and I recently |
| 03:30 | created a video on how I set up my fiest |
| 03:33 | code environment for data science and AI |
| 03:35 | so if you want to refer to that please |
| 03:37 | check out this video I will also link it |
| 03:40 | so let's start with the most |
| 03:41 | straightforward one that is the |
| 03:43 | autocomplete this is a feature that is |
| 03:45 | also very similar to giup co-pilot if |
| 03:48 | you are familiar with that but it has |
| 03:50 | some additional features but for now |
| 03:53 | let's try and start with a we have a |
| 03:55 | main.py here let's start with some |
| 03:57 | typical data analysis so let's try and |
| 04:00 | see if we can import pandas ASD so here |
| 04:03 | you can already see the autocomplete |
| 04:05 | kicking in so it shows it in like gray |
| 04:08 | italic text and what I can now do is I |
| 04:10 | can hit tab to autocomplete then next we |
| 04:13 | can also see hey do you want to create a |
| 04:15 | uh a do you want to create a data frame |
| 04:17 | over here now we don't have a CSV file |
| 04:20 | right now so that probably doesn't make |
| 04:21 | sense but you can see it is suggesting |
| 04:24 | the next steps within your code and you |
| 04:26 | can easily hit tab to autocomplete that |
| 04:28 | the larger your file file the more |
| 04:30 | context you have the better these |
| 04:31 | recommendations are going to get all |
| 04:33 | right so that was the auto complete with |
| 04:35 | tab very straightforward and also not |
| 04:37 | much different from uh GitHub co-pilot |
| 04:39 | for example now to cover the inline |
| 04:41 | edits chat and composer this is where it |
| 04:44 | gets really cool let's first talk about |
| 04:46 | the keyboard shortcuts because this is |
| 04:48 | definitely the best way to work with |
| 04:50 | these AI tools with in cursor now out of |
| 04:53 | the box cursor comes with default |
| 04:56 | hotkeys default shortcuts so either |
| 04:58 | depending on whether windows or Mac uh |
| 05:00 | control or command K to open up a new |
| 05:04 | editing window and then we have the chat |
| 05:06 | we have the composer and also the |
| 05:08 | composer control panel we will show all |
| 05:10 | of those in a bit but I want to |
| 05:12 | highlight one thing and that is when I |
| 05:15 | was migrating from fiest code and I went |
| 05:17 | to the keyboard shortcuts some of these |
| 05:20 | default keyboard shortcuts from cursor |
| 05:23 | were already overwritten because in |
| 05:25 | fiest code I had different key bindings |
| 05:27 | so this took me quite some time to |
| 05:29 | figure out how to uh correct all of this |
| 05:31 | but I have this document over here where |
| 05:33 | you can search for for example the new |
| 05:35 | editor window you can type in AI action |
| 05:38 | model generate and here you can see |
| 05:40 | right now it's command K here you can |
| 05:42 | also check if there are any um |
| 05:45 | interfering key bindings and then same |
| 05:47 | is true for the chat so just if you have |
| 05:51 | any problems with keyboard shortcuts |
| 05:53 | make sure to follow this list all right |
| 05:56 | so now let's demonstrate the inline |
| 05:57 | editor and here you can see that cursor |
| 05:59 | also lets you know the key binding so |
| 06:01 | this is really nice if you forget them |
| 06:03 | so you have command L to chat command K |
| 06:05 | to generate so what I'm going to do |
| 06:07 | right here is I'm going to fire up a |
| 06:09 | python python interactive session and |
| 06:11 | this is part of fias code not of cursor |
| 06:13 | this is just how I like to run my python |
| 06:15 | code and from here I'm going to hit |
| 06:18 | command K here we have the inline editor |
| 06:21 | and here we can essentially start to |
| 06:23 | talk with the AI give instructions uh |
| 06:25 | specify what model we're using and let |
| 06:28 | the AI do its magic so let's create an |
| 06:31 | example data frame for a tutorial on |
| 06:33 | data analysis and I'm going to be using |
| 06:35 | Cloud 3.5 Sonet which is by far the best |
| 06:39 | model for coding right now but you can |
| 06:41 | also see that you can pick the different |
| 06:44 | models over here but for now let's hit |
| 06:46 | enter and see what the AI is coming up |
| 06:49 | with so we can see it appear over here |
| 06:52 | in the uh in the editor and what I |
| 06:55 | really like specifically about cursor |
| 06:57 | compared to for example also giup cop |
| 06:59 | pilot is that it shows the code Snippets |
| 07:02 | that it is suggesting in a way that is |
| 07:04 | very similar to how you review changes |
| 07:07 | within git so you can see the green |
| 07:09 | lines that it's going to add that code |
| 07:11 | and later what what we will see you will |
| 07:12 | also sometimes see red lines if it |
| 07:15 | removes certain code so for now I'm just |
| 07:18 | going to hit command enter to accept |
| 07:20 | this and you can see we have our data |
| 07:23 | frame in here so let's see what that |
| 07:25 | looks like we have a nice data frame and |
| 07:27 | it also suggests here to print the head |
| 07:29 | of the data frame but that is not needed |
| 07:31 | because we can view it over here okay so |
| 07:34 | I think this is a good start but let's |
| 07:36 | actually select this hit command K again |
| 07:38 | and say also add uh a last name |
| 07:43 | column and extend the DF to 20 rows all |
| 07:48 | right so let's see what it comes up with |
| 07:51 | and now it's going to extend this more |
| 07:53 | rows and here we can see the final |
| 07:56 | result and this is what I meant by what |
| 07:58 | I really like about this visually um and |
| 08:00 | now it's s very similar to your |
| 08:02 | experience with Git where it now shows |
| 08:04 | okay in red is what what is currently in |
| 08:07 | your file we're going to remove that and |
| 08:09 | we are going to replace that with |
| 08:11 | everything that is in the green so we |
| 08:14 | can even we can even do that line by |
| 08:15 | line as you can see over here uh by |
| 08:18 | hitting command y or we can again just |
| 08:20 | hit command enter and accept everything |
| 08:23 | so let's run this and now let's look at |
| 08:26 | our data frame and let's see now you can |
| 08:28 | see we have a data frame with also a |
| 08:31 | last name and we have 20 rows in there |
| 08:34 | so that's how we can make edits in line |
| 08:36 | with the editor but we can also hit |
| 08:38 | command L to open up the chat window so |
| 08:41 | let's see this might get a little |
| 08:43 | cluttered over here let's clear this and |
| 08:46 | here we can see that we have the chat so |
| 08:48 | now instead of inline over here we have |
| 08:51 | the current file selected and we can |
| 08:54 | chat with it and I believe we can also |
| 08:56 | make uh selections and then hit the chat |
| 08:58 | so we can can see that you have the |
| 09:00 | lines in here but we can also just |
| 09:02 | reference the whole file and the |
| 09:04 | difference really here is that we have a |
| 09:06 | little bit more of an overview I would |
| 09:09 | say if we use the chat window so what I |
| 09:11 | would recommend is for quick inline |
| 09:13 | edits you can use the inline editor but |
| 09:16 | if you want to do some bigger changes or |
| 09:18 | even multifile changes which we will get |
| 09:20 | into it a bit the chat window is really |
| 09:23 | convenient so let's take this file over |
| 09:25 | here and let's say that we want to now |
| 09:28 | export this data frame to a CSV file all |
| 09:30 | right so I'm asking can you export this |
| 09:31 | data frame to a CSV file in the data- |
| 09:34 | Raw folder so let me show you I have |
| 09:36 | this project structure over here and |
| 09:38 | we're in the source main.py and then uh |
| 09:41 | it should actually be one step above |
| 09:44 | that there is a data raw folder so I can |
| 09:47 | now run this and what it will now do |
| 09:50 | instead of showing this in the uh main |
| 09:54 | file over here that we're working on |
| 09:56 | it's going to show the changes here in |
| 09:58 | the chat so this is one of the |
| 10:00 | difference right before you can saw you |
| 10:02 | saw the green uh the green lines coming |
| 10:04 | coming up in here but here in the chat |
| 10:06 | it's going to suggest how we can do that |
| 10:09 | and it's also going to give us an |
| 10:11 | explanation so this is um this is more |
| 10:14 | similar to how you would code with for |
| 10:16 | example cat GPT open or uh Cloud models |
| 10:19 | open within the web browser right but |
| 10:22 | okay so we can have a look at this and |
| 10:24 | we can see okay this all makes sense so |
| 10:27 | create the directory if it doesn't exist |
| 10:29 | that then we're going to export the CSV |
| 10:31 | file and what we can do is we can hit |
| 10:33 | apply and what it will then do it will |
| 10:36 | then come to your file you can also |
| 10:38 | click on that and it will show the |
| 10:40 | changes and from here we can basically |
| 10:42 | accept everything uh get rid of the chat |
| 10:45 | so we can close that by hitting command |
| 10:47 | L again let's run this and now we can |
| 10:49 | have a look in here and we have an |
| 10:51 | employee data.csv file so that is now |
| 10:54 | how we can take any file and just hit |
| 10:57 | command L and it will open up the chat |
| 10:59 | window and we have an AI experience |
| 11:01 | similar to cat GPT or using clot but |
| 11:04 | without having to switch context and go |
| 11:07 | to the browser but it doesn't stop there |
| 11:09 | because what really sets cursor apart is |
| 11:14 | that it understands the context and the |
| 11:16 | the the structure of your project and we |
| 11:19 | can also reference specific files so if |
| 11:22 | you've done any AI assisted coding what |
| 11:24 | you would typically do you would work on |
| 11:25 | something something then you would copy |
| 11:27 | paste it into uh cat GPT or entropic and |
| 11:30 | then ask can you exp expand on this can |
| 11:33 | you improve it whatever kind of request |
| 11:34 | you would have the AI would then come |
| 11:36 | with that answer and you would have to |
| 11:38 | paste it back into your code base |
| 11:41 | sometimes it has these annoying things |
| 11:43 | where it's like this is your existing |
| 11:45 | code and and insert new code here and |
| 11:48 | then you would have to figure out okay |
| 11:49 | but where is that exactly not anymore |
| 11:52 | with cursor you can not only link the |
| 11:55 | current file that you have but you can |
| 11:57 | even reference or mention the entire |
| 12:00 | codebase documents the web files folders |
| 12:03 | and simply you can simply do that by |
| 12:05 | hitting add and then you can select what |
| 12:08 | you want to add as context and for me |
| 12:10 | like did when I saw this and how good it |
| 12:13 | worked with Cloud Sonet 3.5 that for me |
| 12:16 | was okay I'm going to make the switch so |
| 12:18 | let me show you how this works so we |
| 12:20 | just created the data set I called it |
| 12:22 | data set. pi and let's now say we want |
| 12:25 | to visualize this data and let's say we |
| 12:27 | want to create take the name and we want |
| 12:29 | to take the salary and we want to create |
| 12:30 | a bar plot of that so here's a new file |
| 12:33 | called plot.py we can open up a new chat |
| 12:37 | window currently it has the context of |
| 12:39 | plot.py but what we can now do let's say |
| 12:42 | import the CSV file that you exported in |
| 12:48 | and now here comes it let's do an add |
| 12:50 | let's go to files call it data set. piy |
| 12:53 | so we give this context to the chat |
| 12:56 | window and then uh create a bar chart |
| 13:00 | with name and salary so let's run this |
| 13:05 | and see what it comes up with and here |
| 13:07 | it is providing suggestions for plot.py |
| 13:10 | so we can even click on that if we're |
| 13:12 | not in it we can jump to it we can hit |
| 13:14 | apply and I think everything looks good |
| 13:17 | so let's close the chat window for now |
| 13:19 | let's start this up so now it correctly |
| 13:22 | understands where this CSV file is so |
| 13:25 | that it has to do one step back then |
| 13:26 | load it loads the data and then we can |
| 13:30 | create that figure and it also |
| 13:32 | understands that we in order to plot |
| 13:34 | name and salary it needs the columns |
| 13:37 | name and salary because from within this |
| 13:39 | data data set it could see those column |
| 13:41 | names so I am I'm showing a simple |
| 13:44 | example here but it goes to show that |
| 13:47 | how you can create context and save that |
| 13:49 | context over your code codebase in |
| 13:52 | different files and for me that's really |
| 13:54 | what sets this apart from using for |
| 13:57 | example webbased tools where where you |
| 13:59 | go copy and pasting it works really well |
| 14:01 | if you're working on an isolated problem |
| 14:03 | but this really speeds up so much time |
| 14:06 | when you are working with multiple files |
| 14:09 | so let's see what we got over here so we |
| 14:12 | can uh let's do a PLT do show and that |
| 14:15 | is a pretty nice looking graph that we |
| 14:17 | got going on over here but we can also |
| 14:19 | of course just continue and ask change |
| 14:23 | the colors run everything again oh wow |
| 14:26 | now we have a colored bar chart over |
| 14:28 | here another feature that I quickly want |
| 14:30 | to show you before diving into the |
| 14:32 | composer is using docs so when you do |
| 14:35 | the ad file you can do files folders |
| 14:37 | code you can search the web you can even |
| 14:39 | do your entire code base be careful with |
| 14:41 | this if you have larger code bases |
| 14:43 | because it will get confused but docs is |
| 14:46 | also really cool so if you do docs there |
| 14:49 | are there's already a lot of uh |
| 14:51 | documentation in here so for example the |
| 14:53 | python uh sorry the pandas documentation |
| 14:56 | you can reference that but you can also |
| 14:58 | add at your own doc so I just tested |
| 15:00 | this with penic so penic for that is a |
| 15:04 | python Library you can pip install it |
| 15:06 | wasn't available in here but I just |
| 15:08 | added it so you could just add new Doc |
| 15:11 | put in a a URL in here and it will index |
| 15:15 | that and then next you can just come in |
| 15:17 | here docs then do penic and now it has |
| 15:20 | that that context for that library and |
| 15:23 | this is really effective for newer |
| 15:26 | libraries for example that got updates |
| 15:28 | or were created after the model training |
| 15:31 | cutoff points so that is another awesome |
| 15:33 | feature because documentation is really |
| 15:36 | important and now if you also want to |
| 15:38 | create fancy documentation like for |
| 15:40 | example this document that I have over |
| 15:42 | here you might want to check out clickup |
| 15:44 | which is also the sponsor of today's |
| 15:45 | video now if you're anything like me |
| 15:48 | then juggling all your tasks your |
| 15:50 | projects and your documents can be a |
| 15:52 | real headache that's where clickup can |
| 15:54 | come in because this really is an app |
| 15:56 | that can bring all of that together now |
| 15:58 | I personally love click up because it |
| 16:00 | lets me manage everything in one place |
| 16:02 | so I don't have to jump back and forth |
| 16:05 | between a ton of different apps now also |
| 16:08 | as a developer I really like the GitHub |
| 16:11 | Integrations and automations to manage |
| 16:13 | my projects and creating and sharing |
| 16:15 | documents whether that's for this |
| 16:17 | YouTube video or for my team or for my |
| 16:19 | clients has never been easier just open |
| 16:21 | it up create a document and you're good |
| 16:23 | to go you have nice documents now I've |
| 16:26 | personally tried all the other apps as |
| 16:28 | well like jira notion or linear but to |
| 16:32 | me there was always something missing it |
| 16:34 | was either like documents or uh project |
| 16:36 | development or code but with clickup it |
| 16:39 | just makes made sense I could fit |
| 16:40 | everything in that single a single |
| 16:42 | application so if you're looking to |
| 16:44 | boost your productivity whether that's |
| 16:46 | for personal projects or team |
| 16:47 | collaborations I highly recommend giving |
| 16:50 | clickup a try it's made a huge |
| 16:52 | difference for me check out the link in |
| 16:54 | the description to get started all right |
| 16:56 | so we already covered a lot here but |
| 16:58 | there's one one more thing that I want |
| 16:59 | to show you and that is the composer so |
| 17:02 | that's this thing over here and you can |
| 17:03 | open it up by hitting command or control |
| 17:06 | I so this is again another chat window |
| 17:09 | similar to the inline one and also the |
| 17:12 | chat window but with the composer it's a |
| 17:15 | little bit more focused on generating |
| 17:18 | files already behind the scenes in your |
| 17:20 | code base without first having having to |
| 17:23 | accept it now this is still somewhat of |
| 17:25 | a b feature but I've already had some |
| 17:27 | really good results results with this |
| 17:30 | and this is definitely the future of AI |
| 17:32 | assisted coding so I am going to uh put |
| 17:35 | in an example here this is something I |
| 17:38 | just came up with I have no idea how |
| 17:40 | this is going to work out but we're |
| 17:41 | going to say we want to create a demo AI |
| 17:44 | project using the open AI Library this |
| 17:46 | should be a chat Bol it can answer user |
| 17:48 | questions uh it should use a knowledge |
| 17:50 | base file that it should also create |
| 17:52 | we're going to work in the source source |
| 17:54 | folder so do add source and then I've |
| 17:56 | also said that we are going to use the |
| 17:58 | open AI docs so did add dogs and typed |
| 18:00 | in open AI to get that context in here |
| 18:02 | we're going to use clot Sonet again and |
| 18:05 | let's hit enter to see what's going on |
| 18:07 | here so now it's going to reference a |
| 18:10 | whole lot of stuff it's going to create |
| 18:11 | main.py chatbot knowledge base okay so |
| 18:14 | now we're going to check let's open this |
| 18:16 | up so this folder was empty I removed |
| 18:19 | everything zoom out a little bit to get |
| 18:21 | some uh get some context so we have all |
| 18:23 | the files configs Etc um now let's run |
| 18:26 | the main.py file so let's see we have |
| 18:29 | the main.py for now I'm going to accept |
| 18:31 | everything so now we have all the files |
| 18:34 | we have our knowledge base beautiful we |
| 18:36 | have our configuration so just plugged |
| 18:39 | in the open I key in. EnV file over here |
| 18:42 | switch the model to GPT 40 we have a |
| 18:44 | system prompt so what we got here we got |
| 18:46 | chuckb with the AI assistant personality |
| 18:48 | of Chuck Norris perfect okay let's see |
| 18:52 | what we got going on over here so we can |
| 18:54 | run this and this is going to run and |
| 18:58 | loop over everything so let's just let's |
| 19:01 | just run this so this is going to create |
| 19:02 | a look welcome to the chck uh chat bot |
| 19:04 | ask me anything user what's the highest |
| 19:06 | point on Earth the highest point on |
| 19:08 | Earth is the Mount Everest Etc perfect |
| 19:10 | okay so it's working it's working the |
| 19:13 | context doesn't really matter over here |
| 19:15 | is just goes to show that we with one |
| 19:18 | single prompt we can create within our |
| 19:21 | IDE without having to leave it different |
| 19:24 | files with different context knowledge |
| 19:27 | configurations a chat B and then |
| 19:29 | bringing that together in one file and |
| 19:32 | make it work so that's really how |
| 19:33 | awesome this this can be and quick |
| 19:36 | overview on where we're at right now so |
| 19:38 | Qui quick summary so we covered the |
| 19:41 | editor which I recommend for small edits |
| 19:43 | and autocompletes then we have the chat |
| 19:45 | which you can use for bigger files |
| 19:47 | multifile edits and then we have the |
| 19:48 | composer to generate new files and apply |
| 19:51 | changes across the entire code base but |
| 19:53 | sometimes right now this can be a little |
| 19:55 | bit tricky to figure out what's going on |
| 19:56 | and then if you have to revert those |
| 19:58 | changes |
| 19:59 | can be can get a little messy so use |
| 20:01 | this with caution um you refie the |
| 20:04 | changes similar to how you refie g |
| 20:06 | changes so make sure that you not always |
| 20:08 | like Auto accept but do make sure to get |
| 20:11 | into the habit of figuring out from okay |
| 20:13 | what is the AI suggesting um make sure |
| 20:16 | to manage context correctly with the ad |
| 20:19 | symbol so use files folders code or even |
| 20:22 | entire codebase or docs manage that so |
| 20:25 | give it enough context but not more than |
| 20:27 | necessary then also uh consider starting |
| 20:31 | new chats when you're switching to |
| 20:33 | different features or when chat gets too |
| 20:35 | long so this is also something that I've |
| 20:36 | noticed so if you have the chat over |
| 20:38 | here you can see this is a new chat you |
| 20:40 | can see new chat you have your history |
| 20:42 | over here so I can get back to the to |
| 20:43 | the ptic one uh here we have to change |
| 20:46 | in color so similar to what you used to |
| 20:48 | in the web browser with the ey tools |
| 20:50 | same goes here and then like I've just |
| 20:52 | explained using docs really cool feature |
| 20:54 | especially for after model AI model |
| 20:56 | training cutoffs and Cloud 3.5 Sonet is |
| 21:00 | currently really the best model so if |
| 21:02 | I'm in here command K you can uh select |
| 21:06 | those different models you can also hit |
| 21:08 | command forward slash you can see here |
| 21:10 | over here you can switch models for me |
| 21:13 | leave it at Cloud 3.5 Sonet but if you |
| 21:15 | want to play around that's how you can |
| 21:17 | do it then finally to sum up this video |
| 21:20 | why is it for me personally worth |
| 21:22 | spending another 20 bucks a month on |
| 21:24 | another AI tool well if we compare it to |
| 21:27 | my previous workflow Fiasco get a |
| 21:29 | co-pilot and we compare cursor it's not |
| 21:32 | only limited to opening eyes models |
| 21:34 | which is really the best feature for me |
| 21:35 | because of cloud Sonet and going forward |
| 21:38 | the future this is going to change I |
| 21:39 | expect all these model providers to one |
| 21:42 | up each other every time every month |
| 21:44 | every quarter so having a more flexible |
| 21:46 | tool that you that you can use to |
| 21:48 | quickly adapt is just great also it's |
| 21:51 | for me a much better developer |
| 21:54 | experience compared to giup co-pilot so |
| 21:56 | you have the refuse the undos the change |
| 21:58 | highlight switching between different |
| 21:59 | files is just it feels more native than |
| 22:03 | co-pilot because it's not just an |
| 22:05 | extension cursor really decided to |
| 22:07 | create the fork and then build on top of |
| 22:10 | that that's also uh they Lally explain |
| 22:12 | that it's not cursor is not an extension |
| 22:15 | because they couldn't do some of the |
| 22:16 | things that they wanted to include and |
| 22:19 | you feel that within the experience you |
| 22:21 | also have very granular control about |
| 22:23 | the context that you add this is using |
| 22:25 | these add symbols and the composer it |
| 22:28 | works we've just seen it it actually |
| 22:31 | works it actually creates files in a way |
| 22:33 | that's helpful we can run it out of the |
| 22:35 | box and this is only going to get better |
| 22:38 | um one thing that I don't like that |
| 22:40 | co-pilot has no AI generated commit |
| 22:42 | messages so for the past like I I can't |
| 22:46 | even remember the last time I wrote a |
| 22:48 | custom like commit message so you come |
| 22:50 | in here with co-pilot you have this |
| 22:51 | little Sparkle icon in and you can just |
| 22:54 | uh it will just create a summary of all |
| 22:56 | the changes so uh Team from cursor if |
| 22:58 | you're watching please introduce this I |
| 23:01 | don't like writing commit manages |
| 23:02 | messages anymore all right and that's it |
| 23:05 | for this one I'm curious if you're going |
| 23:06 | to switch to cursor as well let me know |
| 23:08 | down in the comments and then by the way |
| 23:10 | if you're a data professional and you |
| 23:12 | already have some experience you |
| 23:13 | consider freelancing but don't really |
| 23:15 | know where to get started you might want |
| 23:17 | to check out the first link in the |
| 23:18 | description it's a video of me going |
| 23:20 | over how my company can help with this |
| 23:22 | um now in all transparency it's a funnel |
| 23:24 | designed to get leads for my company |
| 23:26 | we're currently temporarily closed for |
| 23:28 | and enrollment but you can sign up for |
| 23:29 | the newsletter if you just want to stay |
| 23:31 | in the loop see what it's all about and |
| 23:33 | then I want to thank you for watching |
| 23:34 | please leave a like if you found this |
| 23:36 | video helpful and also consider |
| 23:38 | subscribing if you want to learn more |
| 23:40 | about AI Engineering Building data |
| 23:42 | Centric applications and then the next |
| 23:44 | video that I would recommend is this |
| 23:46 | fiest code setup that I recently did so |
| 23:48 | this will really tie into this setup |
| 23:51 | with curser everything that you've seen |
| 23:52 | in this video I'll explain it in this |
| 23:54 | video If you combine the two together |
| 23:56 | for me at least the experience with |
| 23:58 | developing with writing code is just so |
| 24:01 | much better |
