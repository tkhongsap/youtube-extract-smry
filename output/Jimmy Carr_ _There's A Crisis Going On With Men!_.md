| 00:00 | I remember the day I remember being at |
| 00:01 | home and and getting the news and |
| 00:04 | laughing and crying and then it hits you |
| 00:07 | I was very |
| 00:08 | uh very upset by it and he was |
| 00:14 | just just so funny you a fantastic crowd |
| 00:17 | thank you very much thank |
| 00:19 | [Applause] |
| 00:22 | you would you please welcome Jimmy one |
| 00:26 | of the most respected and best love |
| 00:28 | comedians in the world |
| 00:30 | the king of on liners okay strap in |
| 00:33 | everyone you ready I'm going to start |
| 00:35 | teaching comedy because it teaches you |
| 00:37 | how to come up with original thoughts to |
| 00:39 | find your voice you'll be chasing |
| 00:40 | impostor syndrome and it's great you |
| 00:42 | should feel it every 18 months you |
| 00:43 | learned that failure is one of the great |
| 00:45 | gifts of standup comedy and to learn how |
| 00:47 | to lose gracefully it's a good test of |
| 00:49 | how much you want something how do we |
| 00:50 | know what we actually want I love what I |
| 00:52 | do now but often question whether I |
| 00:54 | should go be like a DJ D what I can |
| 00:56 | answer that question for you no you |
| 00:58 | shouldn't I know everything do you think |
| 01:00 | oh maybe we can make a few quid out of |
| 01:02 | this no as a guy that's touring the |
| 01:04 | world 300 days a year what advice would |
| 01:05 | you give me on how to be a better |
| 01:07 | Communicator speak at 92 beats a minute |
| 01:09 | when you look at the great public |
| 01:10 | speakers they all seem to be hitting |
| 01:12 | that rhythm of 92 beats a minute anxiety |
| 01:14 | it's the flip side of creativity so I |
| 01:16 | think the cure for managing my anxiety |
| 01:19 | is hang on the Netflix special drops |
| 01:22 | today so I imagine I'm being canceled |
| 01:23 | right now how have you come to deal with |
| 01:25 | that so the next time I get canceled |

| 02:00 | Jimmy it's great to be back what have |
| 02:02 | you been up to I've been you know I've |
| 02:04 | been around I've been working I very |
| 02:06 | much enjoyed this last time and I'm kind |
| 02:08 | of I was a bit nervous coming back |
| 02:11 | because it's a Big Show and I I really |
| 02:14 | enjoy it I really enjoy listening so I |
| 02:16 | I've given it quite a lot of thought |
| 02:18 | I've kind of made loads of notes and uh |
| 02:21 | you know here's what I'll kick off with |
| 02:23 | I've been thinking a lot about gratitude |
| 02:25 | as the mother of all virtues and I think |
| 02:28 | I'm right in saying this I think you |
| 02:30 | would give me everything you own in 25 |
| 02:34 | years time to be the age you are now and |
| 02:38 | as healthy as you are right now and I |
| 02:41 | think it's a really interesting |
| 02:43 | meditation to think about right if you |
| 02:46 | had a time machine if you were 30 years |
| 02:48 | in the future if you could be this |
| 02:50 | healthy and feel this good and be this |
| 02:54 | age you give everything materially that |
| 02:57 | you own in 30 years time to be back here |
| 03:00 | and just that just to take that end for |
| 03:02 | a minute just to take a moment to think |
| 03:03 | about |
| 03:05 | wow this is amazing what does that |
| 03:07 | Inspire in terms of Behavioral change in |
| 03:09 | the moment well I think it's that thing |
| 03:10 | of like I try and I think gratitude is |
| 03:12 | such an important virtue um and it's |
| 03:16 | people talk about gratitude practice and |
| 03:18 | it does take some practice and it often |
| 03:20 | takes like it's a it's like a way of |
| 03:22 | reframing the way that you see the world |
| 03:25 | so I think that we suffer in the west a |
| 03:27 | little bit from Life dysmorphia do you |
| 03:29 | hear a lot about body dysmorphia gender |
| 03:31 | dysmorphia we've got life dysmorphia a |
| 03:34 | lot of people think their life is |
| 03:35 | terrible because there's kind of the the |
| 03:38 | honic treadmill you get used to how |
| 03:40 | great your life is no one had a hot |
| 03:43 | shower until 50 years ago so I Tred and |
| 03:45 | do this thing when you stand in a hot |
| 03:46 | shower George Mack my friend pointed |
| 03:48 | this out to me went well look when you |
| 03:49 | stand in a hot shower just for a moment |
| 03:51 | just go well no one that you admire from |
| 03:53 | 100 years ago had this simple pleasure |
| 03:56 | in life and when you look at the world |
| 03:59 | that we live in we we're like you're |
| 04:01 | doing there been 100 billion people ever |
| 04:04 | right we are in the top top percentile |
| 04:08 | in terms of the luck that we have had |
| 04:11 | the the lives like the the the calorific |
| 04:13 | intake that we just take for granted the |
| 04:15 | fact that our children don't die uh you |
| 04:16 | know in the first year the the modern |
| 04:18 | medicine and our lives and our the |
| 04:21 | entertainment that we get we're living |
| 04:23 | like kings and yet life has never been |
| 04:26 | objectively better and subjectively |
| 04:29 | worse |
| 04:30 | because the nature of humanity is our |
| 04:33 | desires are memetic so we've got this |
| 04:35 | thing where we we sort of you know how |
| 04:37 | happy are you well it's it's your |
| 04:39 | quality of life minus Envy that's how |
| 04:43 | happy you are and it's easy to look at |
| 04:47 | everyone else and how they're doing and |
| 04:49 | and not take pleasure in what you |
| 04:52 | have it's funny because there's a cost |
| 04:54 | to a hot shower isn't there and that's |
| 04:56 | exactly what you're describing there |
| 04:57 | because subjectively I think lot of |
| 04:59 | people don't feel like they are very |
| 05:02 | happy and I think objectively if you |
| 05:03 | look at some of the stats around |
| 05:05 | suicidality and depression and mental |
| 05:06 | health it doesn't appear that people are |
| 05:08 | any happier so even though we have sort |
| 05:10 | of materially improved Our Lives we have |
| 05:13 | hot showers now there's a cost to the |
| 05:15 | hot shower in the sense that um maybe |
| 05:18 | it's made life too easy maybe it's made |
| 05:21 | life too comfortable maybe we're in a |
| 05:23 | comfort crisis yeah I mean there's |
| 05:25 | there's a there's a lot to be said on |
| 05:26 | that I mean it's very I suppose it's |
| 05:28 | very tough love but you can't have an |
| 05:30 | easy life in a Great Character Show show |
| 05:33 | me a trust fund kid that inherited a |
| 05:35 | bunch of money and I'll show you someone |
| 05:37 | mentally |
| 05:38 | tortured it's it's true right everyone's |
| 05:41 | like your your struggle what where |
| 05:44 | you've come from in Plymouth uh you know |
| 05:46 | in living in poverty to now having stuff |
| 05:50 | isn't fun getting stuff is fun right |
| 05:53 | it's not the pursuit happiness it's the |
| 05:55 | happiness of the pursuit right it's it's |
| 05:57 | just it's that thing and it's not like |
| 05:59 | you know that the self-help it's not the |
| 06:00 | journey it's the destination it's not |
| 06:02 | either the journey or the destination |
| 06:04 | it's who you become on the journey and |
| 06:06 | here's the terrible thing about life |
| 06:08 | it's self- |
| 06:09 | assignment like you know there's school |
| 06:12 | and college and then you get dropped |
| 06:13 | into the the real world at some point |
| 06:16 | and look and you go well you you have to |
| 06:18 | decide what you're going to do and you |
| 06:19 | can take an easy path and it's it's |
| 06:22 | ultimately less fun it's short money or |
| 06:25 | you take a hard path and you give |
| 06:26 | yourself a challenge and it's great and |
| 06:28 | I think you know a lot of the times it's |
| 06:30 | that thing of like it's hard to do |
| 06:33 | that's a it's it's life is life is |
| 06:35 | really really tough those are tough |
| 06:37 | things to hear and it's it's easy for us |
| 06:41 | because we're sort of on that road but |
| 06:44 | then you know the thing I love about |
| 06:45 | this podcast is you're sort of trying to |
| 06:47 | there's so much kind of wisdom in it so |
| 06:48 | many stories that you're sort of you're |
| 06:50 | giving people this kind of road map for |
| 06:52 | okay well make your life a little bit |
| 06:54 | harder in the short term and and and get |
| 06:58 | somewhere I mean I I didn't really get |
| 07:00 | what religion was until comparatively |
| 07:03 | late in life like the idea that God is a |
| 07:06 | proxy for the |
| 07:08 | future right so so so God represents the |
| 07:11 | future so work hard now for a better |
| 07:13 | life in heaven right so that's it's kind |
| 07:16 | of it's the same as all self-help like |
| 07:19 | okay so so |
| 07:21 | sacrifice the present for the future |
| 07:23 | work is kind of the same it's a |
| 07:25 | sacrifice of the present for something |
| 07:26 | better in the future that's like it's a |
| 07:29 | it's it's an interesting thing to sort |
| 07:30 | of think around isn't it that like what |
| 07:32 | are you g to do now so I've got this um |
| 07:35 | Chris Williamson you know Chris from |
| 07:37 | he's a really good friend of mine he's |
| 07:37 | lovely guy and we came up with this idea |
| 07:39 | so me him and George Mack were chatting |
| 07:42 | about what what should you do today that |
| 07:46 | you tomorrow would be happy you did so |
| 07:48 | sort of 24 hours in the future how best |
| 07:51 | to live because people sort of set like |
| 07:53 | oh well I'm going to do something for 5 |
| 07:54 | years you know so it's this huge goal |
| 07:58 | but you won't rise to your goal |
| 08:00 | you fall to your systems right so that |
| 08:02 | thing of like what could you do |
| 08:04 | tomorrow what could you do today rather |
| 08:06 | that you'd be happy you did tomorrow |
| 08:07 | whether it's the food you eat the |
| 08:09 | exercise you take the work you do what |
| 08:11 | do you do oh right I went to the gym |
| 08:13 | yesterday I feel great like a a little |
| 08:15 | bit of Doms or oh I wrote 10 jokes and |
| 08:18 | tonight I'm on stage trying those jokes |
| 08:20 | oh well I'm thanks me |
| 08:23 | yesterday I you know I did something |
| 08:25 | that was good so you can kind of time's |
| 08:27 | going to pass whatever you do and you |
| 08:29 | can give yourself gifts in the future |
| 08:31 | you can be rich and you can have a |
| 08:34 | six-pack and you can be successful and |
| 08:37 | you can be in a happy long-term |
| 08:38 | relationship with a beautiful family you |
| 08:40 | can give yourself those those gifts but |
| 08:42 | that there's some tough times in the |
| 08:44 | present to give yourself that gift in |
| 08:46 | the future something I really wanted to |
| 08:48 | ask you about is you've climbed to the |
| 08:50 | very peak of your profession like you |
| 08:52 | really are generational Talent this guy |
| 08:54 | that's what it's true it's true you |
| 08:56 | really you really have you think about |
| 08:57 | where you started off at sort of 25 |
| 08:59 | years old in your mid 20s when you |
| 09:01 | decided to leave that I think |
| 09:03 | advertising business and pursue comedy |
| 09:05 | like where you are now really is must be |
| 09:08 | the Dre a dream you like never really |
| 09:11 | imagined could come true you're at the |
| 09:13 | very peak of your profession and I think |
| 09:14 | at the peak of your profession I wonder |
| 09:17 | sometimes if you wonder more than other |
| 09:19 | people who are still on their Journey up |
| 09:21 | that mountain what the point in all of |
| 09:23 | this is well I think that's that's |
| 09:25 | incredibly interesting okay so there's a |
| 09:27 | couple of things to unpick there so you |
| 09:29 | never feel like you're at the top of |
| 09:30 | your profession because you're a you're |
| 09:32 | standing on the shoulders of giants in |
| 09:34 | whatever industry you're in so you might |
| 09:36 | think oh he's doing he's doing very well |
| 09:38 | uh you know he's got a Netflix special |
| 09:39 | and a new tour and all of the you know |
| 09:41 | all of the things but then inside you're |
| 09:43 | going well I'm as good as the next joke |
| 09:44 | I write so the the thing that I try and |
| 09:47 | do is be quite stoic I'm trying to be |
| 09:49 | I'm trying to do less better I'm trying |
| 09:52 | to just be a stand-up the world ordered |
| 09:54 | a standup comedian and I'm trying to |
| 09:56 | honor that right that's what people want |
| 09:58 | right go out jokes tell jokes push the |
| 10:01 | boundaries great that's your little role |
| 10:03 | in the world do that so the more I focus |
| 10:05 | on that the the the better it gets more |
| 10:09 | people come to the show it's that thing |
| 10:11 | of like I suppose the whole of the world |
| 10:14 | is built on incentives right so you you |
| 10:17 | you put down sugar you get |
| 10:19 | ants you tell jokes you deliver on a |
| 10:21 | show and people come and they enjoy it |
| 10:23 | and then they come back next time what'd |
| 10:24 | you get out of that I mean the |
| 10:27 | self-actualization I suppose the idea of |
| 10:29 | going well I do this thing that I I very |
| 10:31 | much enjoy comedy because it's an |
| 10:34 | immediate feedback loop it's a it's a |
| 10:37 | very lucky business to be in because I |
| 10:39 | don't have to wait like I don't have to |
| 10:41 | discuss with someone ah do you think |
| 10:43 | this joke's going to work or not what do |
| 10:45 | you think do you think it's too |
| 10:46 | offensive or do you think ah tell it |
| 10:49 | test it it's it's kind of it's the |
| 10:51 | Silicon Valley the um you know uh the |
| 10:55 | the Dual testing is is this better than |
| 10:56 | this this or this I'm like an an ition |
| 10:59 | like just is this this or this or this |
| 11:01 | or this this wording or this wording and |
| 11:03 | the audience is a genius the audience |
| 11:04 | tell me what works so it's it's kind of |
| 11:08 | yeah it's it's it's a joyful thing to |
| 11:10 | kind of to write a new show and then to |
| 11:12 | put something on the on the Shelf like |
| 11:14 | the new Netflix special Natural Born |
| 11:16 | Killer now streaming on Netflix is is |
| 11:19 | like it's it feels like I've given |
| 11:21 | people irrefutable proof I am who I say |
| 11:24 | I am and that feels really good like |
| 11:27 | that's what I do that's better than the |
| 11:29 | last one and last time I was on the show |
| 11:32 | I talked about wanting to write longer |
| 11:34 | bits longer form like I I've got a great |
| 11:36 | fast ball but I haven't got a knuckle |
| 11:38 | ball and I wanted to try and write some |
| 11:40 | different bits that maybe made some |
| 11:42 | points and I went away and I did it and |
| 11:44 | for better for worse it's there and I I |
| 11:46 | gave it a shot and I think it's a better |
| 11:48 | more rounded comedy special than the |
| 11:51 | previous one and I and I don't hate the |
| 11:53 | previous one it's got really good jokes |
| 11:55 | in it it's really funny I like it and |
| 11:57 | then the new tour I think will be better |
| 11:58 | again I think you can see you see |
| 12:01 | progress and what are you chasing you're |
| 12:03 | not chasing the the thing it's your |
| 12:07 | you're enjoying the process it's it's |
| 12:08 | being so I don't think you get |
| 12:11 | self-esteem from the six-pack you get at |
| 12:14 | the gym I think you get self-esteem from |
| 12:16 | being the kind of person that goes to |
| 12:17 | the gym every day and I don't think you |
| 12:19 | get anything from the from the show from |
| 12:22 | having done the Netflix special but |
| 12:24 | being the person that put that together |
| 12:26 | is the that's that's the enjoyable thing |
| 12:29 | and you get you get kind of better at it |
| 12:31 | you you know the light the weight |
| 12:32 | doesn't get lighter your back gets |
| 12:34 | stronger I think about this with myself |
| 12:36 | a lot I look at what I'm doing in |
| 12:37 | business and stuff and with the podcast |
| 12:38 | and other things and I go there are |
| 12:40 | moments where my brain will ask myself |
| 12:42 | the question like what's the end goal |
| 12:43 | here because I've got the things that I |
| 12:46 | materially need need to be happy I could |
| 12:48 | retire and just go chill on a boat but |
| 12:50 | for some reason I'm sort of torturing |
| 12:52 | myself in many respects but torturing |
| 12:55 | yourself very hard know what you're |
| 12:57 | doing you're giving yourself a character |
| 13:00 | because you're giving yourself a |
| 13:01 | challenge right we all need the |
| 13:03 | challenge so it's like you know with any |
| 13:05 | kind of mythological story it's the |
| 13:07 | hero's journey and you're on a journey |
| 13:10 | to to to do something to become |
| 13:11 | something right and you what's your what |
| 13:13 | are you doing here what's your role in |
| 13:14 | the world but going and sitting on a |
| 13:16 | beach isn't anything like you there's a |
| 13:18 | reason holidays are are two weeks it's |
| 13:21 | so you have three days of going ah we |
| 13:24 | should get back like holiday should be |
| 13:27 | 10 days but somehow we we' made it two |
| 13:29 | weeks and that's great because it allows |
| 13:31 | people sort of three days of going you |
| 13:32 | know what I've got to get back to work |
| 13:34 | I've got to do something I like that |
| 13:36 | thing of like the top of your profession |
| 13:37 | well you'll always be looking ahead |
| 13:39 | right at someone that's you know if it's |
| 13:41 | for you probably Joe Rogan you go well |
| 13:43 | Joe's got the biggest podcast in the |
| 13:44 | world and what are you number two and |
| 13:47 | you and so you're you've got something |
| 13:49 | to aim at and even if you're number one |
| 13:50 | then you're going to go yeah but radio |
| 13:53 | still bigger so huh like that thing if |
| 13:56 | you'll be chasing something giving |
| 13:57 | yourself maybe an artificial |
| 13:59 | um goal in the future but it's a it's a |
| 14:03 | it's just a um something to point you in |
| 14:07 | the right direction is there a little |
| 14:08 | bit of unhappiness sort of voluntary |
| 14:10 | unhappiness involved in wanting to that |
| 14:14 | thing off in the future you think you |
| 14:16 | know because if there's I sat with a |
| 14:17 | psychologist a psychiatrist the other |
| 14:18 | day who was on the podcast and he said |
| 14:20 | if you live your life continually |
| 14:22 | wanting you're essentially deferring |
| 14:23 | your happiness and replacing it with |
| 14:25 | sort of discontent in the moment well |
| 14:27 | this is I mean listen even the worst |
| 14:29 | people say great things chairman ma said |
| 14:32 | uh you can't smell the roses from a |
| 14:34 | galloping horse so when you're moving at |
| 14:37 | that kind of speed you don't take any |
| 14:39 | time to enjoy life right so you have to |
| 14:41 | just just enjoy the moment but you enjoy |
| 14:44 | these conversations you enjoy the thing |
| 14:46 | that you do now the hard work is a lot |
| 14:48 | of the stuff around it you know the |
| 14:50 | travel and the the admin or whatever but |
| 14:51 | you have to love the whole job you can't |
| 14:54 | just go well I want that bit because in |
| 14:56 | the same way that people are jealous of |
| 14:57 | you there'll be other podcasters that |
| 14:58 | are very jealous of what you've got but |
| 14:59 | they're jealous of what you've got |
| 15:01 | they're not jealous of how you got it no |
| 15:04 | comedians are jealous of how I got it no |
| 15:07 | one sits there and goes oh I wish I |
| 15:08 | could sit for 10 hours a day and write |
| 15:09 | jokes oh they think I'd want to play |
| 15:12 | that venue or I'd love to have that |
| 15:14 | Netflix special but they don't sit there |
| 15:15 | going well what pathology would you need |
| 15:17 | in your head to write that many on |
| 15:19 | liners and to care that much about it |
| 15:22 | who would you have to be to do that and |
| 15:25 | we're all chasing something right I |
| 15:26 | think we're chasing impostor syndrome I |
| 15:29 | think imposter syndrome's got a bad |
| 15:30 | reputation and it's great you should |
| 15:31 | feel it every 18 |
| 15:34 | months as you level up you should feel |
| 15:37 | like do I belong here right this show is |
| 15:40 | much bigger than it was when I was last |
| 15:42 | on congratulations you why is it bigger |
| 15:44 | well because you pushed yourself and you |
| 15:46 | worked harder right and now sometimes |
| 15:49 | you feel like oh my God I'm interviewing |
| 15:50 | this |
| 15:51 | person great don't feel comfortable |
| 15:54 | lovely as soon as you start to feel |
| 15:56 | comfortable you need to push yourself a |
| 15:57 | little bit further there's a great story |
| 15:59 | my friend told me this a very Nam droppy |
| 16:00 | story you mind good all right Brandon |
| 16:02 | Flowers told me this story so he's |
| 16:04 | filming a video with Lou Reed like 10 |
| 16:06 | years ago they did a song with Lou Reed |
| 16:07 | which is preall for the killers and |
| 16:09 | they're filming this video and they're |
| 16:11 | backstage they're in the they're in the |
| 16:13 | uh the The Green Room and Lou Reed's |
| 16:17 | there he's got leather trousers on he's |
| 16:18 | got a leather jacket and a vest he's got |
| 16:20 | mirrored |
| 16:21 | sunglasses he's Lou Reed and he looks in |
| 16:24 | the mirror and Brandon sort of sees him |
| 16:26 | just like checking himself out and Lou |
| 16:28 | re just goes I wish I was that |
| 16:33 | guy Lou Reed's got imposter syndrome and |
| 16:36 | he's Lou Reed there's nothing to matter |
| 16:38 | with it you know a guy that's been a |
| 16:39 | rock star and a legend for 40 years is |
| 16:41 | still feeling that thing of like going I |
| 16:43 | don't feel like I'm that guy great |
| 16:45 | that's how you should feel so if you |
| 16:47 | haven't felt imposter syndrome in the |
| 16:49 | last 12 18 months you think there's |
| 16:51 | something probably what push yourself a |
| 16:53 | little bit hard I mean it depends it |
| 16:54 | depends what you want to do you can have |
| 16:55 | an easy life some people you know work |
| 16:59 | to live some people live to work it's |
| 17:01 | it's there's different ways of doing |
| 17:02 | things it's not necessarily you don't |
| 17:04 | necessarily need to push yourself in |
| 17:06 | that way like you're listening to us and |
| 17:08 | and you know there might be a |
| 17:10 | psychiatrist listening going well these |
| 17:11 | guys are pathologically ambitious this |
| 17:13 | isn't healthy they should just be you |
| 17:16 | know chilling out and maybe they have a |
| 17:19 | good |
| 17:20 | point I look at your work ethic and I |
| 17:23 | just feel like I've never seen anything |
| 17:24 | like it for someone who is incredibly |
| 17:26 | successful I look at your tour dates and |
| 17:28 | I'm like this guy spends how many dates |
| 17:31 | a year on stage maybe 300 shows a year |
| 17:33 | something like that 300 shows a year |
| 17:35 | well most people turn up to work every |
| 17:36 | day don't they I |
| 17:39 | mean you know it's also most people like |
| 17:42 | get get your average listener to the |
| 17:44 | show and go okay do you want to swap |
| 17:45 | lives you you have to work for two hours |
| 17:47 | a day but You' be telling jokes to |
| 17:49 | people and it's joyful it's what what |
| 17:52 | looks like work to other people and |
| 17:55 | feels like play to you there you go |
| 17:58 | there's there say like as a really happy |
| 18:00 | life that people go oh my God he worked |
| 18:02 | so hard and I'm going you're joking |
| 18:03 | aren't you you are literally joking and |
| 18:05 | then you go oh the tour dates like this |
| 18:07 | last week I was in I know what South |
| 18:09 | Africa Paris Istanbul Budapest |
| 18:12 | Vienna what a life what because really |
| 18:16 | that's the other thing about life people |
| 18:17 | don't want to live longer they want more |
| 18:19 | memories and and really how do you get |
| 18:21 | more memories well it's it's doing novel |
| 18:24 | interesting things so if you commute to |
| 18:27 | work every day the same commute for a |
| 18:29 | year you don't have 300 memories of that |
| 18:32 | commute you've got one memory right but |
| 18:34 | if you do different things every day you |
| 18:36 | go to different places you talk to |
| 18:37 | different people you you experience the |
| 18:38 | what that's a fantastic that Variety in |
| 18:41 | life gives you more memories more life |
| 18:45 | you pointed at your head a second ago |
| 18:46 | and said we must be pathological in some |
| 18:49 | way yeah do you think you are yeah yeah |
| 18:52 | I'm not sure I'm the I don't know I mean |
| 18:54 | I'm not sure I'm not entirely sure if |
| 18:55 | comedy isn't a uh some sort of low-level |
| 18:58 | Mental Health issue that you can turn |
| 18:59 | into a career I it's you know it's like |
| 19:01 | for most people it seems quite strange |
| 19:03 | to want to stand on stage and uh and |
| 19:05 | tell jokes I think it's it sounds |
| 19:07 | terrifying to a lot of people but I find |
| 19:09 | it very very fun Have you ever figured |
| 19:11 | out why you are wide in such a way not |
| 19:14 | really I mean I suppose that thing of it |
| 19:16 | goes back to Childhood it goes back to |
| 19:19 | um my mother was an incredibly funny |
| 19:21 | Larger than Life Irish woman I was very |
| 19:23 | very close to her I believe they call it |
| 19:25 | in meshed when you have like a very |
| 19:26 | close relationship with your mother um |
| 19:28 | uh and she suffered with uh depression |
| 19:32 | and I didn't know you don't know as a |
| 19:33 | kid your house is just your house you |
| 19:35 | think it's normal right so if your mom's |
| 19:37 | in a dressing gown when you get home |
| 19:38 | from school and she hasn't got herself |
| 19:40 | together you just think well that's what |
| 19:41 | mom's are like so my whole childhood was |
| 19:43 | aimed at making her laugh especially |
| 19:45 | when |
| 19:46 | driving fun thing to do make your mom |
| 19:49 | laugh grab the steering wheel try and |
| 19:51 | you know have you had to unpack that to |
| 19:55 | stop that getting in the way whatever |
| 19:58 | that driving is getting in the way of |
| 19:59 | your adult life cuz I've thought about |
| 20:01 | that a lot myself I think the things |
| 20:02 | that have driven me here aren't |
| 20:04 | necessarily the same things that are |
| 20:07 | going to help me succeed in the next |
| 20:08 | phase of life whether it's being a |
| 20:09 | father like I know you you know you've |
| 20:11 | you had a kid I think in |
| 20:13 | 2019 um or whether it's being in a |
| 20:15 | romantic relationship I've had to kind |
| 20:17 | of really work hard to |
| 20:18 | unpack things so that I can succeed in a |
| 20:21 | new season listen I'm not a therapist |
| 20:23 | but here's what I would say I think |
| 20:25 | you're going to have to make a |
| 20:26 | transition from looking at uh measurable |
| 20:29 | metrics to immeasurable metrics I think |
| 20:32 | you've got an amazing resume you've got |
| 20:34 | an incredible CV of stuff you've done |
| 20:37 | and achievements and stuff you can point |
| 20:38 | at and and the the amount of views on |
| 20:41 | the website and the money that you've |
| 20:42 | made and the businesses You' started |
| 20:44 | great and I think the immeasurable stuff |
| 20:47 | is going to become much more important |
| 20:49 | so George Mack has this kind of theory |
| 20:51 | on we trade in life the measurable for |
| 20:54 | the immeasurable so you trade work for I |
| 20:58 | know time with parents can't really |
| 20:59 | measure time with parents and it's kind |
| 21:02 | of it's tough to lunch with your parents |
| 21:05 | as opposed to the job and the thing and |
| 21:06 | the work and that I'm busy I'm busy I'm |
| 21:07 | busy and you only notice it when it goes |
| 21:10 | to |
| 21:12 | zero so mom dies and you go well I'll |
| 21:14 | never see her again what wouldn't you |
| 21:16 | give now for another meal another time |
| 21:18 | another thing so you go trying to find |
| 21:20 | that balance in life and I think |
| 21:23 | parenting and being a father is about |
| 21:27 | that isn't it it's about that |
| 21:29 | it's about trading the the measurable |
| 21:31 | for the immeasurable Warren Farrell |
| 21:33 | tells a great story do you know Warren |
| 21:35 | Farrell it's like the myth of male power |
| 21:37 | I think a lot of his writing's been used |
| 21:38 | by nefariously by people sort of that |
| 21:41 | are a bit anyway he's a very interesting |
| 21:43 | guy and he's he's very uh authentic um |
| 21:47 | and he told this story I heard him tell |
| 21:48 | this story he said uh said this guy came |
| 21:50 | to me and very successful man you know |
| 21:54 | head of head of a business that makes |
| 21:56 | millions really doing very well and he |
| 21:59 | said he was unhappy because he had |
| 22:03 | worked all the way through his son's |
| 22:07 | childhood and he didn't he hadn't bonded |
| 22:09 | with his son because he'd just been away |
| 22:11 | at |
| 22:12 | work and he went went to see Warren |
| 22:15 | farell and he's a you know psychiatrist |
| 22:17 | or whatever and he said uh okay what are |
| 22:19 | you going to do he said well I'm going |
| 22:20 | to I'm going to give up my job for 5 |
| 22:23 | years and I'm going to be at home with |
| 22:25 | my kid get I'm [ __ ] it I'm not doing any |
| 22:29 | of that I'm going to be with my kid for |
| 22:32 | 5 years just being that moment and he |
| 22:35 | did it and he was very happy that he did |
| 22:39 | it it was John |
| 22:44 | lenon and no matter how important you |
| 22:47 | think your job is you're not John |
| 22:50 | lenon you know I'm sure he could have |
| 22:52 | done great things in those 5 years but |
| 22:55 | you think oh my God I'm so glad he did |
| 22:56 | that I'm so glad |
| 22:59 | cuz of what an incredible artist he was |
| 23:00 | he'd given us so much and that he had |
| 23:03 | those years for himself and that's for |
| 23:05 | him I mean I I imagine he's kid I |
| 23:07 | imagine Shawn lon's very glad he did |
| 23:09 | that but he got that |
| 23:11 | time and I imagine he didn't regret |
| 23:15 | it and and his life was cut short |
| 23:19 | tragically and you think it's even more |
| 23:21 | powerful when you consider that that he |
| 23:23 | didn't put it off he didn't go well I'll |
| 23:25 | do that I'll do I I'll get to I'll get |
| 23:27 | to a million subscribers and then I'll |
| 23:29 | do that I'll sell a few more records and |
| 23:31 | then one more tour and then I'll spend |
| 23:32 | time with the family he he did it isn't |
| 23:35 | that |
| 23:36 | beautiful there's a lot of emotion in |
| 23:38 | your face when you tell that story it's |
| 23:40 | beautiful story isn't it I mean I could |
| 23:43 | when you think about it you go that's |
| 23:45 | kind of that's life isn't it and the and |
| 23:48 | mortality I think is something we don't |
| 23:50 | think about enough right I love that the |
| 23:53 | Muslim uh uh phrase for death uh the |
| 23:56 | certainty |
| 23:59 | you know we're in this brief shaft of |
| 24:02 | Light Between Two Oceans of |
| 24:04 | Darkness everyone always thinks about |
| 24:06 | the tail end right and thinks about what |
| 24:07 | happens after you die Mark Twain had |
| 24:10 | this great quote you know we we um he |
| 24:12 | said uh he said I wasn't alive for |
| 24:14 | billions of years before my birth and it |
| 24:17 | didn't inconvenience me in the |
| 24:21 | least but this brief shaft of Lights |
| 24:23 | kind of it's magnificent isn't it I |
| 24:26 | think so I think it can |
| 24:29 | be this idea of um you know depression |
| 24:33 | is essentially thinking about yourself |
| 24:34 | too much you last time we spoke on the |
| 24:36 | podcast you talked about I would say |
| 24:39 | yeah sorry that that feels to me maybe a |
| 24:41 | little bit too harsh because I think |
| 24:43 | people suffer with depression and that's |
| 24:45 | a it's a disease and it's incredibly |
| 24:48 | serious and we think of suicide as being |
| 24:52 | something that stands alone it's not |
| 24:53 | it's a symptom of a disease called |
| 24:55 | depression right so it's the it's the |
| 24:57 | permanent solution to attemp problem you |
| 24:59 | don't want to feel this way anymore but |
| 25:02 | actually you don't want to feel nothing |
| 25:05 | anymore uh you like to feel better so |
| 25:07 | it's that thing of like I don't think we |
| 25:09 | talk about it enough but I think that |
| 25:10 | thing of you know thinking about |
| 25:11 | yourself all the time I think just leads |
| 25:14 | to a can lead to a Melancholy a sadness |
| 25:17 | I think depression is maybe a slightly |
| 25:18 | separate thing not to nickp but it feels |
| 25:21 | like it feels like that's a disease yeah |
| 25:23 | and there's also a lot of sadness in the |
| 25:25 | world MH and you're lucky if you're sad |
| 25:28 | because if you're if you're sad it's |
| 25:30 | circumstantial and you can do something |
| 25:31 | about it you know are you depressed |
| 25:34 | because you have serotonin imbalance in |
| 25:36 | your head and it's a heritable trait or |
| 25:39 | are you sad because your life hasn't |
| 25:41 | worked out the way you want it to work |
| 25:42 | out well if that's the case the latter |
| 25:44 | you're in luck because you can change |
| 25:46 | that it does feel like there's a bit of |
| 25:47 | a crisis going on within young men at |
| 25:50 | the moment and I think your new show on |
| 25:51 | Netflix shines a light on many of the |
| 25:54 | difficulties that young men are facing I |
| 25:56 | I was really excited to talk to about |
| 25:57 | this particular topic cuz I've been |
| 25:59 | trying to arrive at a position myself on |
| 26:02 | why so many young men appear to be lost |
| 26:04 | and suicidality has increased and |
| 26:07 | there's you know these |
| 26:09 | new masculine influences or masculine |
| 26:13 | influencers that are really rounding up |
| 26:15 | this cohort of young men who who are we |
| 26:17 | talking about and Tate Andrew Tes of the |
| 26:19 | world well Andrew T interesting isn't he |
| 26:20 | because um who made the I think John |
| 26:22 | meany made the observation Trump is a |
| 26:24 | poor person's idea of what a rich person |
| 26:26 | looks like yeah got gold Taps and I |
| 26:29 | think s of Andrew Tate is like a |
| 26:31 | 14-year-old boy's idea of what |
| 26:33 | masculinity might look like like it's |
| 26:36 | really it's it's and and of course |
| 26:38 | nature abor a vacuum and there's a real |
| 26:41 | vacuum for um Elders like we now we |
| 26:45 | don't learn how to shave from our |
| 26:46 | fathers it's a YouTube video and so you |
| 26:49 | lose something in that in that bonding |
| 26:52 | so there's a big bit in the new show |
| 26:54 | where I give a young guy an audience |
| 26:55 | member a pretty tough time like we have |
| 26:58 | the talk and I give them advice on how |
| 27:02 | to uh be with a woman and it's I'm not |
| 27:06 | wrong about anything it's really funny |
| 27:08 | and it's really rude but I'm not wrong |
| 27:10 | about stuff it's like it's about consent |
| 27:12 | and it's it's I think it's really it's |
| 27:14 | really good because it's I've sugared |
| 27:15 | the pill of the message because people |
| 27:17 | don't want to talk about it people go |
| 27:18 | it's obvious what consent is yeah not to |
| 27:20 | 17-year-old boys or girls it's like |
| 27:23 | actually what what does that look like |
| 27:24 | and how should that be so it's uh yeah |
| 27:26 | it's a it's a really fun routine really |
| 27:28 | fun routine to perform and to write what |
| 27:30 | is it to be a man these days cuz it's |
| 27:31 | quite confusing in ter even the |
| 27:33 | conversation around like chivalry and |
| 27:35 | understanding you know well people talk |
| 27:37 | about toxic masculinity and easy fix be |
| 27:40 | a gentleman be a |
| 27:42 | mench that's it this is done be a |
| 27:45 | gentleman be a mench you know a |
| 27:47 | gentleman is never rude by |
| 27:49 | accident it's Christopher Hitchin line |
| 27:52 | great I I don't know I mean my thing |
| 27:54 | about young men today if I was going to |
| 27:55 | give young men advice it would be |
| 27:59 | get the right drugs and the real thing |
| 28:03 | right in real life live in real life |
| 28:06 | right so why young men are obsessed by |
| 28:08 | video games right obsessed they're |
| 28:10 | spending hours and hours and hours |
| 28:11 | online playing video games why well |
| 28:14 | that's a proxy for career right video |
| 28:16 | games you think about the levels of |
| 28:18 | video games and what people do on video |
| 28:19 | games it's that's a proxy that's like a |
| 28:22 | uh it's a it's a substitute for the |
| 28:23 | career that they're not having and then |
| 28:25 | they spend a lot of time you know |
| 28:27 | fapping to to Pornhub or uPorn or |
| 28:31 | whatever and that's a proxy for sex and |
| 28:36 | my thing would be George Orwell wasn't |
| 28:40 | right our power won't be taken away from |
| 28:42 | us by some authoritarian master we're |
| 28:45 | going to give it away for cheap dopamine |
| 28:48 | and the cheap dopamine of video games |
| 28:50 | and online porn and living online is is |
| 28:55 | is getting in the way of real life so |
| 28:57 | it's risk |
| 28:58 | right that's that's what we're not |
| 29:00 | allowing young people to do because we |
| 29:02 | we're saying to young people you can't |
| 29:04 | take risks in real life we're we're |
| 29:06 | helicopter parenting we're not giving |
| 29:08 | them the freedom how much Freedom should |
| 29:09 | you give a kid as much as they can cope |
| 29:12 | with right 14year olds used to be |
| 29:14 | babysitters they now need |
| 29:17 | babysitters that's not good right so you |
| 29:19 | should allow them more freedom in in the |
| 29:21 | real world because otherwise the only |
| 29:24 | place they get freedom is |
| 29:26 | online and no freedom in the real world |
| 29:28 | you're not allowed to go to the park and |
| 29:29 | hang out but you're allowed to do |
| 29:31 | whatever you want online well that's a |
| 29:33 | that feels like a very bad social |
| 29:35 | experiment that feels like a bad |
| 29:38 | idea yeah it feels like we've |
| 29:41 | inverted um Ma you know masloff this P |
| 29:44 | pyramid hierarchy of needs and you go |
| 29:48 | well food and shelter and warmth and all |
| 29:50 | the we've got all the bottom stuff |
| 29:52 | worked out in our society right we we |
| 29:53 | kind of can't see it we're not grateful |
| 29:55 | for that because we can't see the hot |
| 29:57 | shower the hot sh we can't see the third |
| 29:59 | world and we can't see the people in the |
| 30:00 | past having a tougher time than us so we |
| 30:02 | take it for granted but we worked out |
| 30:03 | that stuff they hadn't worked that stuff |
| 30:05 | out 200 years ago but they had the top |
| 30:08 | of the pyramid sorted everyone knew who |
| 30:11 | they were they had their identity and |
| 30:12 | they knew what their purpose was |
| 30:15 | everyone knew who they were what they |
| 30:17 | were about and they were connected to to |
| 30:20 | the others in the in the group and now |
| 30:22 | we're kind of free floating individuals |
| 30:24 | we kind of worship the individual as if |
| 30:27 | as if we can survive as |
| 30:28 | individuals I always think of that thing |
| 30:30 | of like there's no such thing as a |
| 30:33 | baby there's a baby in a mother there's |
| 30:36 | a baby and a father baby and an auntie |
| 30:38 | but there's no such thing as a baby |
| 30:40 | because a baby on its own isn't anything |
| 30:41 | it's it's dead it's you it needs taken |
| 30:44 | care of we're all still babies we all |
| 30:48 | need the |
| 30:49 | connections you yourself yeah sure |
| 30:51 | there's there's a lot of yourself that's |
| 30:53 | that's within you but a lot of it is out |
| 30:55 | in the world it's connected to other |
| 30:57 | people and it kind of it mediates who |
| 30:59 | you think you are and that's you know |
| 31:01 | that's that's slightly missing from |
| 31:03 | society where you kind of live online |
| 31:05 | and you're kind of a self-authored thing |
| 31:07 | you're just on on the computer on the |
| 31:09 | screen and you're not connected and |
| 31:10 | you're not taking risks taking risks is |
| 31:13 | really |
| 31:14 | important is this in part due to the |
| 31:16 | rise in atheism and agnosticism I think |
| 31:18 | we we both me and you lost our sort of |
| 31:21 | religious Faith around the same age |
| 31:23 | think sort of early mid mid mid 20 I |
| 31:26 | think it's a weird thing where you go |
| 31:28 | you can lose your I I certainly don't |
| 31:29 | believe in the stories there's two types |
| 31:31 | of fools right there's people that take |
| 31:33 | religion literally and there's people |
| 31:35 | that think it has no |
| 31:36 | value okay both both idiots for |
| 31:39 | different reasons like it works as a |
| 31:42 | thing religion I quite I miss it because |
| 31:45 | the reason the ceremony Works isn't |
| 31:46 | because God's pleased it's because the |
| 31:48 | people came together and so I think we |
| 31:50 | look for things that that are um proxies |
| 31:52 | for religion and sometimes that's could |
| 31:56 | football it could be Environ ISM you |
| 31:58 | know because you go well I need |
| 32:00 | something I need purpose in my life I |
| 32:01 | need to feel like I'm I'm adding value |
| 32:04 | and what a great cause I'm going to save |
| 32:06 | the planet it's a big thing to think |
| 32:08 | about it's got a religiosity to it but I |
| 32:10 | don't think that's the you know I don't |
| 32:12 | think that's necessarily the answer you |
| 32:14 | know some people do it with politics |
| 32:15 | they think politics is going to is going |
| 32:17 | to be Heaven they're going to they're |
| 32:19 | going to come up with some perfect |
| 32:20 | system I think you're putting too much |
| 32:23 | pressure on politics first time I've |
| 32:25 | ever said this actually but when you |
| 32:27 | just said I I think Miss religion I |
| 32:28 | think I miss religion it's nice wasn't |
| 32:30 | it it's a lovely thought as well when |
| 32:32 | you lose someone that you love very much |
| 32:34 | it's a lovely thought I mean Heaven is |
| 32:36 | just it's a lovely thought and I think |
| 32:38 | in a way in our culture Fame and Fortune |
| 32:41 | has replaced |
| 32:42 | Heaven it's the land of milk and honey |
| 32:46 | and where you can feel like you're um uh |
| 32:49 | everything's okay everything's taken |
| 32:51 | care of um and it is |
| 32:54 | good but it's it's not it's not heaven I |
| 32:57 | don't believe in an afterlife I believe |
| 32:59 | in a next |
| 33:01 | life so I don't think anything happens |
| 33:03 | after you die but I think you can have a |
| 33:04 | next life a very different life so it's |
| 33:07 | interesting you're at this point of your |
| 33:09 | your life when you're thinking about |
| 33:10 | well we might start a family it's a |
| 33:12 | whole other life it's a whole other |
| 33:15 | you'll hardly recognize yourself you and |
| 33:17 | your partner will be saying what did we |
| 33:18 | do what did we do all day now we're not |
| 33:21 | a Peppa Pig World or wherever you find |
| 33:24 | yourselves it's really just struck me |
| 33:26 | that I do kind of Miss religion but it |
| 33:27 | feels like when I lost my religion I put |
| 33:29 | a backpack on a backpack full of weights |
| 33:32 | on and I think that's what the |
| 33:33 | responsibility and individualism is I |
| 33:35 | mean for me the the loss of religion was |
| 33:37 | A Rush of Blood to the Head it was like |
| 33:39 | oh I I this is my life and I need to |
| 33:42 | make good on this and I need to live it |
| 33:45 | the tragedy is most people don't have |
| 33:47 | that kind of they don't get to kind of |
| 33:49 | follow their their their dream when you |
| 33:52 | were 28 years old your mother died who |
| 33:53 | had a you know a profound influence on |
| 33:55 | you for many reasons but also has very |
| 33:57 | much the inspiration or at least the |
| 33:59 | singular biggest causal factor of your |
| 34:01 | career when I read through your story |
| 34:03 | even more recently you've undergone |
| 34:05 | quite a lot of grief even the loss of |
| 34:07 | your dog I believe um which had a pretty |
| 34:10 | large impact on you I think grief is |
| 34:12 | cumulative so every time you lose |
| 34:14 | someone or something uh and and actually |
| 34:17 | losing a pet can be it's a weird thing |
| 34:18 | because people lose pets and it's like I |
| 34:20 | don't know the other people in the |
| 34:21 | office can be about H okay oh well what |
| 34:23 | we doing for lunch it's like can be a |
| 34:25 | really affecting thing because it's not |
| 34:27 | just just everyone you've lost and you |
| 34:29 | think about mortality but you think |
| 34:31 | about your own mortality and you think |
| 34:33 | about you know you kind of think about |
| 34:35 | it takes you to a very melancholy place |
| 34:37 | of like at some point you got to say |
| 34:39 | goodbye and I guess you think about |
| 34:41 | those things of going what are the you |
| 34:43 | know in life as we were talking about |
| 34:45 | the the the great you can have great a |
| 34:47 | great resume great CV loads of stuff on |
| 34:50 | it but what are people going to say at |
| 34:53 | your eulogy that's the important thing |
| 34:56 | that's the stuff that really matters |
| 34:58 | and it's a very different it's again |
| 35:00 | it's the it's the it's a hidden metric |
| 35:03 | of what are people going to say at your |
| 35:05 | your funeral what what are people going |
| 35:06 | to say when you when you |
| 35:08 | pass uh I don't know I think grief's |
| 35:11 | it's a it's very interesting it's very |
| 35:13 | it is that thing of it you know kind of |
| 35:14 | comes in waves and you think about it |
| 35:16 | for a long time and then it and then it |
| 35:18 | hits you how have you dealt with grief |
| 35:20 | in your |
| 35:21 | life I mean I I I think when my uh I |
| 35:25 | don't know I think I think I'm slightly |
| 35:28 | guilty of you know suppressing it a |
| 35:30 | little bit I think when uh I think when |
| 35:32 | Shawn lock died I was very |
| 35:35 | uh very upset by it and you just go to |
| 35:39 | work you just kind of go well I'll I'll |
| 35:41 | put myself in this joyful place of |
| 35:43 | laughter and maybe not have to think |
| 35:45 | about it as much but it's |
| 35:47 | uh yeah it's you know they gone forever |
| 35:51 | and there was something really amazing |
| 35:52 | about when sh died because people shared |
| 35:55 | so much online so you had |
| 35:59 | these clips of like I remember the day I |
| 36:02 | remember being at home and and getting |
| 36:04 | the news and laughing and crying kind of |
| 36:07 | real kind of um cognitive dissonance of |
| 36:10 | like feeling really upset and then they |
| 36:11 | played just all the funniest clips of |
| 36:14 | Sean like people just sending me clips |
| 36:16 | clips clips and he was just so funny and |
| 36:20 | that Joy is kind of there it's it's it's |
| 36:24 | really lovely it's really like for all |
| 36:26 | of social media ills on that day my God |
| 36:30 | it made a |
| 36:32 | difference what did it make you realize |
| 36:34 | about both sha and life when he |
| 36:37 | passed I I don't know whether there's |
| 36:39 | any great Revelation in it I think it's |
| 36:42 | that thing of just you know enjoy you |
| 36:44 | know enjoy your time enjoy the enjoy |
| 36:47 | this because it's fleeting I mean all |
| 36:51 | too fleeting for for Sean who's very |
| 36:52 | young uh but it's you know I think that |
| 36:55 | that thing of |
| 37:02 | you know family and and you know |
| 37:04 | spending time with the people that you |
| 37:05 | love and and doing what you love I think |
| 37:07 | prioritizing that it's if you want to |
| 37:09 | meet someone high agency meet someone |
| 37:12 | that's got six months to live I'd say |
| 37:14 | their tolerance for [ __ ] is is about |
| 37:16 | as low as it |
| 37:18 | gets I think living your life like that |
| 37:20 | is not a bad idea if really shows you |
| 37:22 | what your priorities would be someone |
| 37:23 | said you had six months to live well |
| 37:24 | what would you |
| 37:25 | do that's how what you should be doing |
| 37:29 | anyway yeah that's really what I'm what |
| 37:31 | I'm getting at is there's something that |
| 37:33 | facing our own mortality teaches us um |
| 37:36 | but unfortunately we have to we often |
| 37:38 | learn that when we we haven't got a lot |
| 37:39 | of time to implement it and sometimes |
| 37:41 | when we when someone close to us passes |
| 37:44 | away we can vicariously learn that |
| 37:45 | message about our immortality and what |
| 37:48 | really what our priority should be and |
| 37:49 | really how we should be living our life |
| 37:50 | and really What mattered the most and I |
| 37:53 | imagine losing someone that was as close |
| 37:55 | to you as Sha was sends you some kind of |
| 37:58 | message about priorities and life and |
| 38:02 | gratitude and all these things we talked |
| 38:04 | about |
| 38:05 | yeah I think it's yeah I think gr |
| 38:07 | gratitude's a big part of it as well |
| 38:09 | that idea of kind of going wow that was |
| 38:11 | that was pretty |
| 38:14 | special you you were I might grab I |
| 38:17 | might grab another coffee can I grab the |
| 38:18 | rest of my coffee yeah yeah is that all |
| 38:19 | right am I allowed yeah he said breaking |
| 38:22 | with format I might shuffle my notes as |
| 38:24 | well I'm going to shuffle my notes |
| 38:28 | this is a business podcast or at least |
| 38:30 | that's how it started and is it have You |
| 38:33 | Have you listened back CU I don't think |
| 38:35 | it is I'll be honest with you it's it's |
| 38:38 | not this is but business is life you |
| 38:41 | know what I mean and they're the same |
| 38:42 | thing the communication mental health |
| 38:45 | striving progress people relationships |
| 38:47 | it's all business at the end of the day |
| 38:49 | it I mean you are re I mean this I mean |
| 38:53 | I know it's still cool diary the CEO but |
| 38:55 | re I don't think you've talked about |
| 38:56 | business on this for like 3 years and |
| 38:59 | even then it was like a passing so when |
| 39:01 | you started your business how did that |
| 39:03 | make you feel it's this isn't you're an |
| 39:06 | old hippie is what you are you love this |
| 39:08 | is a great podcast but this is a |
| 39:10 | storytelling podcast so many of so many |
| 39:13 | entrepreneurs are old hippies I think of |
| 39:15 | Steve Jobs he was an Old Hippie yeah you |
| 39:17 | know and it's interesting I think that |
| 39:19 | thing of like uh what does business |
| 39:21 | teach people like we're talking about |
| 39:22 | like young men and and kind of there's a |
| 39:24 | bit of a crisis going on out there uh |
| 39:26 | with young men and and young women are |
| 39:28 | not having an easy time either but it's |
| 39:30 | that thing of like the the suicide rate |
| 39:32 | whatever um is horrific with young men |
| 39:35 | and you go well what's going on and it's |
| 39:37 | agency I don't think we're giving young |
| 39:39 | people enough agency so they don't feel |
| 39:41 | like they have they have control and |
| 39:43 | really I think the thing of like serial |
| 39:46 | entrepreneurs like no one ever seems to |
| 39:48 | hit on their first company but it's the |
| 39:50 | second and third and fourth and but they |
| 39:51 | just keep going they go well I'm never |
| 39:53 | going to work for anyone I'm going to do |
| 39:54 | it myself that's kind of I don't think |
| 39:55 | we're teaching enough of that uh it's |
| 39:57 | it's a weird thing CU like teaching |
| 39:59 | someone to be a self-starter is kind of |
| 40:01 | a contradiction in terms but it's it it |
| 40:04 | kind of works right there's I think |
| 40:06 | we're teaching the wrong things I've Got |
| 40:07 | a Theory I think I'm going to start |
| 40:08 | teaching |
| 40:10 | comedy and and okay so comedy is very |
| 40:14 | new it really you could trace its roots |
| 40:16 | back to George Carlin and Richard PRI in |
| 40:18 | the early 70s as like one guy on stage |
| 40:21 | in a big theater and he's selling |
| 40:22 | tickets and people are just seeing him |
| 40:24 | right you can trace it back to the dawn |
| 40:26 | of time but really the modern standup |
| 40:29 | early '70s is a good good starting point |
| 40:32 | right so it's a very new medium compared |
| 40:33 | to music and film right it's very new so |
| 40:35 | I sort of view George Carlin and uh |
| 40:38 | Richard PR they're John the Baptist |
| 40:40 | right and and Jesus isn't here yet and |
| 40:43 | it's this new evolving medium and unlike |
| 40:46 | music we don't have a language yet so we |
| 40:49 | need a language of like okay what are |
| 40:51 | the joke types and how could you how do |
| 40:52 | you how do you write that down how do |
| 40:53 | you configure it there's too much |
| 40:55 | magical thinking around stand-up comedy |
| 40:58 | you know the idea that I I just I just |
| 41:00 | came up with it it's just yeah I just |
| 41:03 | but actually learning how jokes work and |
| 41:05 | uh systematizing and uh analyzing them I |
| 41:08 | think really helps so I've been working |
| 41:10 | on a book with um uh Amanda Baker who |
| 41:12 | helped me on my first book uh we've been |
| 41:14 | working on a thing together for the last |
| 41:15 | couple of years trying to teach comedy |
| 41:17 | and I think I think there's a real |
| 41:19 | benefit to it because if you think about |
| 41:20 | music in schools right we'd all argue |
| 41:22 | learning music's great right it's great |
| 41:24 | idea teach kid the piano grade three |
| 41:27 | learn something about music and they'll |
| 41:28 | appreciate music much more in life I |
| 41:30 | think comedy is much more relevant right |
| 41:31 | what does comedy teach you right it |
| 41:32 | teaches you you would you learn to kind |
| 41:34 | of you find your self and you find your |
| 41:37 | voice and you learn to communicate your |
| 41:38 | ideas and to order them and write them |
| 41:40 | down and uh to communicate it's very |
| 41:44 | valuable like the great tragedy of life |
| 41:46 | is most people live and die and never |
| 41:49 | hear their own |
| 41:51 | voice everybody wants to be a better |
| 41:53 | speaker a better Communicator you know |
| 41:55 | it's funny cuz I sat with a guy called |
| 41:57 | um Julian treasure who has I think Ted |
| 42:00 | Talk on communication and speaking that |
| 42:02 | did I don't know 30 40 million views and |
| 42:05 | he said I also did a Ted Talk on |
| 42:06 | listening I can no one listen to it |
| 42:08 | everyone listen to the talk about being |
| 42:10 | a better |
| 42:12 | speaker that's that's that's pretty |
| 42:14 | funny uh the uh yeah know I could |
| 42:16 | imagine that you as a as a guy that's |
| 42:18 | touring the world 300 days a year you |
| 42:20 | must have really been able to break down |
| 42:22 | the science of communication and being a |
| 42:24 | good speaker that's transferable to |
| 42:26 | business public speaking life sales |
| 42:29 | Etc what would what advice would you |
| 42:31 | give me on how to be a better speaker |
| 42:35 | Communicator all right |
| 42:37 | okay 92 beats a |
| 42:39 | minute what do that mean speak at 92 |
| 42:42 | beats a minute that's there you go I |
| 42:45 | mean there's kind of a science behind it |
| 42:47 | and I've looked into it but most great |
| 42:49 | public speakers sort of speak in a |
| 42:50 | rhythm but it doesn't matter how fast |
| 42:52 | they're speaking but they're kind of |
| 42:53 | hitting 92 beats a minute so I tend to |
| 42:57 | listen to a playlist of songs that are |
| 42:58 | all 92 beats a minute before going on |
| 43:00 | stage I know that sounds like Madness |
| 43:03 | you know and it's it may be it is but I |
| 43:06 | think there's something about that |
| 43:07 | Rhythm that just the audience that kind |
| 43:10 | of um the proximal speed of cognition |
| 43:13 | that idea everyone kind of gets into |
| 43:14 | that Rhythm and when you look at the |
| 43:17 | great public speakers they all seem to |
| 43:19 | be hitting that that rhythm of 92 beats |
| 43:21 | a minute do you think Trump's a good |
| 43:22 | public speaker yeah he's an excellent |
| 43:24 | public speaker of course I don't know |
| 43:27 | why people would have a problem |
| 43:29 | admitting that it's I mean he's kind of |
| 43:31 | and he's freestyling it's like there's |
| 43:33 | nothing planned this is this is |
| 43:35 | insane um yeah it's uh because he really |
| 43:39 | leads into sort of exaggerated |
| 43:42 | storytelling and emotion much more than |
| 43:44 | facts and figures than most politicians |
| 43:47 | I mean it's a it's you know there's a |
| 43:50 | theory that this is all Gwen Stefani's |
| 43:52 | fault what do you mean okay so Donald |
| 43:55 | Trump was pres was hosting the |
| 43:57 | Apprentice uh and Gwen Stefani was on uh |
| 44:01 | America's Got Talent or one of the |
| 44:03 | singing shows maybe it was fact anyone |
| 44:05 | one of those big singing shows he found |
| 44:07 | out she was getting paid more than him |
| 44:10 | and so he wanted to build his relevance |
| 44:13 | right so he decided Well I know I'll run |
| 44:16 | for president I'll become incredibly |
| 44:18 | relevant for like three months he's a |
| 44:21 | contender he's whatever and then you |
| 44:23 | drop out the race no problem at all so |
| 44:24 | he hires all those people in Plaza and |
| 44:27 | he comes down the gold escalator and he |
| 44:29 | does the speech and great okay nothing |
| 44:32 | he then goes and there's footage of this |
| 44:34 | he then goes and |
| 44:35 | does the first make America great again |
| 44:38 | rally and they've got foot job him |
| 44:40 | walking up the steps and he sees like |
| 44:42 | 10,000 people all |
| 44:45 | chanting and there's the |
| 44:48 | realization oh oh this could be |
| 44:52 | real it's kind of a yeah I think that's |
| 44:55 | I think that's stani did it get |
| 44:59 | her I was the reason I was I was talking |
| 45:01 | about business is because because this |
| 45:04 | is don't have a CEO it's a podcast about |
| 45:06 | business is is because you taught me |
| 45:08 | last time sort of indirectly about |
| 45:11 | something that I've now developed and I |
| 45:13 | call myself no man's land which is that |
| 45:15 | moment when you make a decision to leave |
| 45:17 | the comfort and security of your |
| 45:19 | identity your professional um you know |
| 45:22 | Endeavor what whatever it is you were |
| 45:24 | working in marketing and then like I |
| 45:25 | always reference how objectively insane |
| 45:28 | it was for you to leave that and go and |
| 45:30 | become a comedian and I've I've dubbed |
| 45:32 | that no man's land that sort of six to |
| 45:35 | 12 months of looking a bit stupid of |
| 45:38 | losing your friends losing you know I |
| 45:40 | refer to these five buckets in life you |
| 45:41 | have your knowledge skills your network |
| 45:44 | your resources and your reputation and |
| 45:46 | when you go into No Man's Land you fill |
| 45:48 | the first two buckets of your Knowledge |
| 45:49 | and Skills but you empty the last three |
| 45:51 | you lose your network you lose your |
| 45:52 | resources often you lose your reputation |
| 45:54 | whatever that was at the time but you |
| 45:56 | fill these two buckets you made that for |
| 45:58 | whatever reason decision to leave a |
| 46:01 | normal life and go and tell jokes for no |
| 46:05 | money some people for some reason and |
| 46:07 | I've seen consistently on this podcast |
| 46:09 | like Darren Brown who was had a great |
| 46:11 | professional life ahead of him and |
| 46:12 | decided to go do card tricks on tables |
| 46:14 | in Bristol for 10 years I what is it |
| 46:17 | about these people that's making them I |
| 46:19 | think they've had the realization right |
| 46:21 | they've they've had the confucious |
| 46:22 | moment every man has two lives and he |
| 46:25 | second begins when he realizes is he |
| 46:27 | only has |
| 46:28 | one and the good is the enemy of the |
| 46:33 | best cuz you know when people are on |
| 46:35 | podcast like this that moment looks like |
| 46:38 | bravery but I I wonder if to you and |
| 46:42 | when you quit your sort of marketing job |
| 46:44 | no there's plenty of 4:00 in the morning |
| 46:46 | ah what have I done this seems this |
| 46:49 | seems crazy especially when you really |
| 46:51 | kind of when you break because when you |
| 46:52 | leave as well you don't have like an |
| 46:54 | hour of great stuff of like that you've |
| 46:57 | written you've got like 20 minutes of |
| 46:59 | stuff that you kind of look back on and |
| 47:00 | go it's kind of joke shaped there's |
| 47:02 | something there but really it's it's |
| 47:05 | insane yeah but I think that's great I |
| 47:08 | think failure is one of the great gifts |
| 47:10 | of standup |
| 47:12 | comedy you you sort of make friends with |
| 47:14 | failure as a standup because you write |
| 47:16 | so many things that don't work you write |
| 47:18 | so many jokes that you think oh this is |
| 47:19 | going to be great and then you tell it |
| 47:20 | and the audience go no that isn't |
| 47:21 | anything guess again and that idea of |
| 47:25 | going yeah failure failure is kind of |
| 47:27 | frowned upon in our society we don't let |
| 47:28 | kids fail we don't let kids lose at |
| 47:31 | sports we don't let you know that it |
| 47:34 | it's it's really silly because you're |
| 47:35 | sort of teaching them if if everyone's a |
| 47:37 | winner then you don't learn how to lose |
| 47:40 | and to learn how to lose gracefully is |
| 47:44 | that's a great skill to have isn't it |
| 47:47 | and and you kind of you know it checks |
| 47:49 | your ego and you you some not everything |
| 47:52 | in life is going to work out for you and |
| 47:54 | it's okay so you you test it and it's a |
| 47:56 | good test of how much you want something |
| 47:58 | you go and have you have a terrible gig |
| 47:59 | and well I'm never doing that again or |
| 48:01 | you have a terrible gig and go well you |
| 48:03 | know you you lose or you |
| 48:06 | learn you develop your relationship with |
| 48:09 | no I've someone said this to me the |
| 48:11 | other day and it really stuck with me |
| 48:12 | that you need you know I worked in Telly |
| 48:14 | celles for a couple of years and it |
| 48:15 | really helped me develop my relationship |
| 48:17 | with the answer no and so now in life I |
| 48:20 | I think I have a much healthier |
| 48:21 | relationship with the word no because |
| 48:23 | for me in call in it's that the law of |
| 48:26 | averag is where in the call center all |
| 48:28 | it meant was that I was one step closer |
| 48:30 | to getting the yes so I'd get you know |
| 48:32 | you get loads of noes in a row and you |
| 48:33 | sit there and go [ __ ] know this next |
| 48:34 | guy's going to buy these [ __ ] double |
| 48:36 | glazing and I think at at 16 years old I |
| 48:38 | developed that relationship with no |
| 48:39 | which me meant in my head that it was |
| 48:41 | getting me closer to a positive outcome |
| 48:43 | lots of kids don't have that these these |
| 48:44 | days because we Shield them from no no |
| 48:47 | is you know seen as a self-esteem hit |
| 48:49 | for me it was building some kind of |
| 48:50 | muscle in me I don't but self-esteem on |
| 48:53 | its own like confidence without |
| 48:56 | competence is |
| 48:58 | madness it's Madness you you have to |
| 49:00 | give the world irrefutable proof you are |
| 49:03 | who you say you are right so you you |
| 49:06 | release a comedy special or whatever you |
| 49:07 | go yeah that's me that's what I do the |
| 49:09 | new tour that's me that's what I do it's |
| 49:11 | it's irrefutable evidence right I am who |
| 49:13 | I say I am and I think that idea of |
| 49:15 | going taking away the the negatives you |
| 49:18 | can't just I mean I mean you can but |
| 49:20 | then I think we're I think it's very |
| 49:21 | cruel I think we're being kind on the |
| 49:24 | wrong time scale to people |
| 49:27 | if you're kind you want to be kind to |
| 49:29 | your kids right I want to be kind to my |
| 49:30 | kids what do my kids want well they want |
| 49:32 | McDonald's and they want ice cream and |
| 49:33 | they want to watch TV and play video |
| 49:34 | games well okay Downstream are some fat |
| 49:38 | stupid |
| 49:39 | kids who wants fat stupid kids no one so |
| 49:43 | you have to be kind to their potential |
| 49:46 | to who they're going to be right and |
| 49:48 | that involves you know broccoli and |
| 49:50 | homework there boring going on a walk |
| 49:54 | doing some exercise |
| 49:57 | okay but but you're being kind later and |
| 50:00 | I think that it's very easy to see that |
| 50:01 | when you're a parent uh and it's hard to |
| 50:04 | see that with an 18-year-old that's |
| 50:07 | maybe struggling TI to your point about |
| 50:09 | being kind to you in 24 hours I guess |
| 50:13 | it's a similar thing right like like |
| 50:15 | seeing the potential in in someone |
| 50:17 | seeing the potential in yourself in a |
| 50:19 | child in anyone but in yourself that's |
| 50:21 | kind of the thing of going well you |
| 50:22 | could be incredible in 20 years time cuz |
| 50:25 | really that thing of like |
| 50:27 | it's it's the um I suppose what's the |
| 50:30 | the opposite of gratitude it's |
| 50:34 | resentment and who had the Great Line |
| 50:36 | nature had the great line on resentment |
| 50:39 | he said if you think someone's ruined |
| 50:40 | your life you're |
| 50:42 | right it's |
| 50:45 | you like that's a mic drop isn't it |
| 50:48 | that's such a great line and you know |
| 50:51 | gratitude is the cure for that there's a |
| 50:53 | there's a great definition of |
| 50:55 | entitlement uh uh which is where you are |
| 50:59 | now and where you want to be if you want |
| 51:01 | to do something about it that's |
| 51:04 | ambition where you are now where you |
| 51:06 | want to be if you think that's someone |
| 51:07 | else's |
| 51:08 | problem that's |
| 51:11 | entitlement and I think if we're honest |
| 51:14 | there's always a little bit of that |
| 51:16 | going on like there's a lot of people in |
| 51:18 | my industry that would you know that |
| 51:20 | their career isn't where they think it |
| 51:21 | should be and ah I need to get a new |
| 51:25 | agent really you think that might be the |
| 51:28 | problem remember there's a great story |
| 51:30 | of uh I wasn't there but uh David tell |
| 51:33 | is sort of the comedians comedian is |
| 51:36 | works out in New York late night uh he's |
| 51:39 | I mean really one of the greats one of |
| 51:40 | the one of the most influential voices |
| 51:42 | in comedy and these guys backstage were |
| 51:44 | like moaning about their |
| 51:46 | management and he's kind of overhearing |
| 51:48 | this conversation it's going on for far |
| 51:49 | too long and he just he oh be funnier |
| 51:57 | it's often very simple that stoic thing |
| 51:59 | of going what's the thing you meant to |
| 52:01 | be doing just do that I'm not sure I |
| 52:04 | approve of portfolio sort of uh working |
| 52:08 | the idea of having lots of different |
| 52:09 | things that you do because |
| 52:11 | really you going to do comedy part-time |
| 52:14 | what you're going to do half comedy and |
| 52:16 | half novel writing oh so you're going to |
| 52:20 | compete I'm doing it 100% of the time |
| 52:22 | and you think you can compete 50% of the |
| 52:24 | time all the best let's see how you do |
| 52:28 | you're never going to get to the top of |
| 52:29 | the pyramid doing it 50% of the time |
| 52:31 | right yeah and there'll probably be a |
| 52:33 | lot of resentment as you say an |
| 52:34 | entitlement be you know be be a |
| 52:37 | specialist it's one of the favorite |
| 52:39 | parts of my previous conversation that I |
| 52:41 | had with you where you you talk about |
| 52:42 | the world doesn't need more people that |
| 52:43 | are [ __ ] in physics and it really helped |
| 52:45 | me understand a lot of things I also |
| 52:46 | then shortly after Met Richard Branson |
| 52:48 | in New York and he's the most you know |
| 52:50 | incredible delegator he's not trying to |
| 52:52 | get good at things that he's not good at |
| 52:54 | he's built his whole business and life |
| 52:55 | on realizing what he's [ __ ] at and just |
| 52:58 | handing that over to other people |
| 52:59 | whereas so many people are fighting to |
| 53:01 | polish something that they're not so |
| 53:03 | good at yeah I think knowing who you are |
| 53:05 | is quite important for that isn't it |
| 53:07 | it's like being honest about it like |
| 53:08 | well I'm not good at that but I can do |
| 53:10 | this it's hard to know who you are |
| 53:11 | though clouded you want to be yeah it's |
| 53:14 | well yeah it's it's also that thing of |
| 53:16 | uh it takes a bit of |
| 53:18 | time I'm not sure whether we're not kind |
| 53:19 | of rushing people on that a little |
| 53:22 | bit I'm i i s often think of like the |
| 53:25 | listeners to this show right so like |
| 53:28 | certainly the younger ones of kind of |
| 53:30 | going well do I need to know now who I |
| 53:32 | am and what I want to do exactly it's no |
| 53:35 | you could you know try a few different |
| 53:36 | things see what you like because I think |
| 53:38 | that thing when you get into the stream |
| 53:39 | that you're meant to be in it just feels |
| 53:41 | very easy it's like you're not you're |
| 53:43 | not you know swimming against the tide |
| 53:45 | just feels like it's carrying you |
| 53:47 | along I love what I do now but I often |
| 53:51 | question whether I should go be like a |
| 53:52 | DJ or do musical theater or something |
| 53:55 | what me do what I can answer that |
| 53:57 | question for you that's a bit of luck no |
| 54:00 | no you [ __ ] |
| 54:01 | shouldn't what what you think you maybe |
| 54:04 | should do musical theater who what are |
| 54:09 | you having a panic attack what what are |
| 54:11 | you talking |
| 54:13 | about what would make you think that I I |
| 54:16 | bought some DJ equipment and I spent |
| 54:17 | about a year learning and I thought I |
| 54:18 | [ __ ] love doing this great you've got |
| 54:22 | hobby you've got a hobby not |
| 54:24 | everything's a business I know it's di |
| 54:26 | over CEO and everything you do you think |
| 54:28 | oh maybe we can make a few quid out of |
| 54:29 | this no stop it what are you talking |
| 54:33 | about you know who's you know who's |
| 54:35 | being a DJ right now there's someone |
| 54:37 | right now in their bedroom they've been |
| 54:39 | there for 12 hours already today and |
| 54:41 | they're just loving it and they're |
| 54:43 | putting everything into it they're |
| 54:45 | putting the work you put into the |
| 54:46 | podcast into |
| 54:48 | DJing let them have that it's nice to |
| 54:51 | have stuff where you're in a flow state |
| 54:52 | in life and for some people that's work |
| 54:54 | and for some people that's a hobby and |
| 54:56 | and some some of us are very lucky and |
| 54:58 | we get to do it in a few different |
| 54:59 | things so I play a little bit |
| 55:02 | tennis I don't think I'm going to get |
| 55:04 | the wild card at Wimbledon this year |
| 55:06 | there I've given up on that it's just a |
| 55:09 | hobby and listen I mean you might be the |
| 55:11 | next Calvin Harris I might be steering |
| 55:12 | you in the wrong direction you might be |
| 55:14 | incredible but stop it stop it just do |
| 55:17 | this this is great this is |
| 55:20 | enough it's is lovely you're talking to |
| 55:22 | the most interesting people I mean |
| 55:23 | present company accepted but you you |
| 55:24 | know you speak to all these different |
| 55:26 | people from different worlds and it's |
| 55:28 | it's this is enough right how do you |
| 55:31 | know if it isn't enough well I want to |
| 55:34 | talk to you about quitting because |
| 55:35 | there's going to be a cohort of people |
| 55:36 | that listen to them I meet them I met a |
| 55:37 | lot of them last night at a show I was |
| 55:38 | doing and they are working in finance |
| 55:40 | and they'll tell me their job then |
| 55:42 | they'll show me their hobby on their |
| 55:43 | phone and their face lights up when they |
| 55:45 | show me their I don't know their Pap and |
| 55:47 | mashe business or whatever it is on |
| 55:49 | their phone what's the great line it's |
| 55:50 | the uh you know if you if you want to |
| 55:51 | find out what you should do in |
| 55:55 | life what do you think about all the |
| 55:57 | time that's your |
| 55:58 | [Music] |
| 56:00 | god what working in the city with a |
| 56:02 | shirt and tie on at JP Morgan or |
| 56:03 | something no but no one's thinking about |
| 56:05 | that all the time you know so what do |
| 56:07 | you what do you think about all the time |
| 56:08 | what are you what are you engaged in all |
| 56:10 | the time like if it's if it's football |
| 56:11 | if you're absolutely obsessed by |
| 56:12 | football well something in that industry |
| 56:14 | is going to be the job for you because |
| 56:16 | you're obsessed by that and that's what |
| 56:17 | you think about all the time so the um |
| 56:19 | the idea of quitting quitting is quite |
| 56:22 | interesting |
| 56:23 | because oh the things that you won't do |
| 56:26 | like if you're going to have an |
| 56:28 | interesting life you can't have all the |
| 56:31 | other interesting lives you would have |
| 56:33 | had right so there's all the |
| 56:34 | counterfactuals of the different sliding |
| 56:36 | doors that you could have done like well |
| 56:39 | you know if you're going to be an |
| 56:40 | Olympian you're going to have to give up |
| 56:42 | an awful lot of stuff like you're not |
| 56:44 | really going to have a childhood in the |
| 56:45 | traditional sense but you're going to be |
| 56:47 | an Olympian great and if you if you're |
| 56:50 | going to be an academic then you're |
| 56:52 | probably not going to be having to go to |
| 56:54 | as many parties okay well that's you |
| 56:56 | know there's there's no Solutions only |
| 56:58 | trade-offs you know Thomas S isn't |
| 57:01 | it you have to make a lot of trade-offs |
| 57:04 | because not only you know are you on the |
| 57:06 | road 300 days a year but you have so |
| 57:07 | much opportunity there's so many things |
| 57:09 | being offered to you to do movies why |
| 57:10 | don't you try and be an actor or why |
| 57:12 | don't you write five more books or why |
| 57:14 | don't you do I don't know a comic |
| 57:15 | comical musical or whatever it might be |
| 57:17 | why don't you become a DJ DJ and musical |
| 57:19 | theater those are my two prime loves um |
| 57:22 | yeah I mean there's there's a few |
| 57:24 | there's not as many as you would think I |
| 57:25 | don't no one's banging down my door |
| 57:26 | saying you want to be in a movie um and |
| 57:29 | I don't know if I'd be I don't know if |
| 57:30 | I'd be great at that I don't know I mean |
| 57:33 | listen I like getting out my comfort |
| 57:34 | zone and you know opportunities come |
| 57:36 | along and sometimes you you get offed a |
| 57:38 | TV show you go well give it a go why not |
| 57:40 | um but I think sticking to what you do |
| 57:42 | that stoic thing has really paid |
| 57:44 | dividends that really has paid off and I |
| 57:48 | think you have to listen to that you |
| 57:50 | know and I see other Comics you know |
| 57:51 | mentioning no names there's some great |
| 57:53 | standup Comics that were like absolutely |
| 57:55 | amazing and they're doing five other |
| 57:57 | things now and they've lost a yard of |
| 57:59 | pace and for me that feels crazy like |
| 58:03 | you've because I'm looking at it going |
| 58:04 | you've got the best job in the world why |
| 58:07 | are you allowing yourself to be |
| 58:10 | distracted because ultimately it's going |
| 58:12 | to be hard work you know ultimately I |
| 58:15 | mean people can see it I suppose that |
| 58:17 | the you know something costs more like a |
| 58:20 | a Ferrari cost a lot of money cuz a lot |
| 58:21 | of work goes into it right there's a lot |
| 58:23 | of work goes into that thing there a the |
| 58:25 | beautiful handmade made Louis Vuitton |
| 58:27 | thing is it's going to be expensive |
| 58:29 | because a lot of work went into it |
| 58:30 | people understand that I sort of feel |
| 58:31 | the same about shows you're going to see |
| 58:33 | a show you go wow that really took some |
| 58:35 | time every single line in that is |
| 58:37 | brilliant he's not wasting any time it's |
| 58:39 | no there's no fat it's just it's a lot |
| 58:41 | of |
| 58:43 | work when people look at you and they |
| 58:45 | look at successful individuals they |
| 58:46 | think oh they just must be innately |
| 58:48 | motivated in some way that I'm not well |
| 58:50 | I do think that's it's slightly unfair |
| 58:53 | that we think about luck in a very fixed |
| 58:56 | way right so Barbie and Oppenheimer are |
| 59:00 | great to talk about this right so people |
| 59:02 | see Margo Robbie and they go well she's |
| 59:04 | just lucky right she was born she's that |
| 59:06 | beautiful right she's so beautiful |
| 59:08 | people can't see how good an actress she |
| 59:10 | is right people just can't because she's |
| 59:12 | just like sort of this stunning thing |
| 59:14 | and and you look Oppenheimer right no |
| 59:16 | one thinks a he so lucky born with an IQ |
| 59:19 | of |
| 59:20 | 170 a and born with a work ethic because |
| 59:24 | a work ethic is heritable right so he |
| 59:26 | was born incredibly clever and an |
| 59:30 | incredible work ethic right and no one |
| 59:32 | thinks of him as being lucky but they |
| 59:33 | think of her is being lucky it's weird |
| 59:37 | thing right that's odd in our perception |
| 59:40 | of of luck and how much is how much is |
| 59:43 | your factory settings you know this it's |
| 59:46 | always I've talked to you about this |
| 59:48 | before but it's always like some some |
| 59:50 | [ __ ] uh if someone's very successful |
| 59:52 | you either go wow incredible Talent OR |
| 59:55 | oh he works so hard no always both |
| 60:00 | together always both |
| 60:02 | together and or like you said earlier |
| 60:04 | maybe a bit pathological in some way |
| 60:06 | which I don't know whether you'd put |
| 60:07 | Talent bucket again you put the |
| 60:09 | pathological the work ethic the the |
| 60:11 | striving a lot of that is |
| 60:13 | heritable you know so what what are you |
| 60:16 | going to do I think when you when you |
| 60:18 | see luck in that way I think you become |
| 60:20 | much more forgiving of |
| 60:23 | okay it's quite crazy this idea of luck |
| 60:25 | i' think been thinking a lot about it |
| 60:27 | lately I was reading some stories about |
| 60:29 | um even the asteroid hitting Earth if it |
| 60:32 | had been a minute later than the |
| 60:33 | dinosaurs would still be here and the |
| 60:35 | story of Nagasaki and Hiroshima being |
| 60:37 | bombed because one guy went to Kyoto 20 |
| 60:39 | years earlier and he really liked it so |
| 60:40 | he told president truma not to bomb it |
| 60:42 | and if he hadn't been on holiday there |
| 60:43 | with his wife then Kyoto would have been |
| 60:46 | hit by the nuclear bomb and then they |
| 60:47 | went over kakuru I think a city in Japan |
| 60:50 | and that had a cloud so they s [ __ ] it |
| 60:52 | we'll go bomb Hiroshima and 100,000 |
| 60:53 | people over there lost their lives and |
| 60:55 | every generation that would have come |
| 60:57 | lost you think these tiny little things |
| 60:58 | that are going on in the world at all |
| 60:59 | times kind of like this this idea of the |
| 61:01 | butterfly effect shaping our world and |
| 61:03 | it can make you feel a little bit |
| 61:04 | powerless in some way because if I'm the |
| 61:06 | you know if if someone's holiday can be |
| 61:09 | the difference between me being alive or |
| 61:10 | dead yeah it's you know it's very |
| 61:13 | difficult to to you know we we always |
| 61:14 | you know think about the first order |
| 61:16 | effects of what we do not the second and |
| 61:18 | third order effects yeah so yeah I mean |
| 61:22 | that's a that's a lot to that's a lot to |
| 61:23 | take in with this idea of luck in mind |
| 61:26 | mind personal responsibility seems to |
| 61:28 | sit on the other side of the |
| 61:29 | conversation of luck which is how much |
| 61:31 | can I control where I'm going in my life |
| 61:33 | how much control do I have how much |
| 61:35 | should I show up and [ __ ] fight for |
| 61:37 | positive outcomes yeah well that's |
| 61:40 | agency you should you should strive to |
| 61:42 | have the locus of control within |
| 61:46 | yourself like so there's there's |
| 61:48 | character and there's reputation and |
| 61:50 | reputation is what the world thinks of |
| 61:51 | you and character is what you know about |
| 61:53 | yourself and your self-esteem should be |
| 61:55 | Lar based on your character and a little |
| 61:58 | bit based on reputation because |
| 62:02 | reputation you could you could take a |
| 62:03 | hit every now and then you get canceled |
| 62:06 | once in a while well once every 18 |
| 62:07 | months well hang on the the Netflix |
| 62:09 | special drops today so I imagine I'm |
| 62:12 | being cancelled right now somewhere how |
| 62:14 | have you come to deal with that cuz as a |
| 62:15 | comedian you guys get it worse than |
| 62:17 | anybody I don't know if we get it worse |
| 62:18 | than anyone I think we're sort of the |
| 62:19 | canary in the mind it's it's I don't |
| 62:22 | know I sort of view it as respectability |
| 62:25 | is a prison and the gates are open and |
| 62:27 | people are desperate to be |
| 62:29 | inside right I I'm not a respectable guy |
| 62:31 | I tell very edgy out there jokes and |
| 62:34 | jokes are like magnets they attract some |
| 62:37 | people I've got a big following I've got |
| 62:38 | a lot of people that watch my shows and |
| 62:40 | and they really enjoy it and like |
| 62:43 | magnets they the jokes attract people |
| 62:45 | and they repel people some people are |
| 62:47 | repelled by my jokes and they think |
| 62:48 | they're terrible I'm not for everyone I |
| 62:50 | think you have to accept that and you |
| 62:53 | know it's it's when it comes out on |
| 62:55 | Netflix when it drops DRS that's when it |
| 62:57 | kind of the pathogen escapes the lab |
| 62:59 | because people that didn't pay to see |
| 63:01 | this are suddenly exposed to it someone |
| 63:03 | puts a clip somewhere and goes this ban |
| 63:04 | this filth |
| 63:06 | okay Banning stuff it's like I sort of |
| 63:09 | view Council culture as the new and this |
| 63:10 | isn't saying criticism isn't valid you |
| 63:12 | can criticize ideas but you cancel |
| 63:14 | people and I think the cancel culture |
| 63:17 | thing I think it's the new book burning |
| 63:19 | it's no different the people that burnt |
| 63:20 | The Beatles records in the 60s how do |
| 63:24 | they feel now you feel like a dummy I |
| 63:26 | bet they feel like dummies it's like and |
| 63:29 | and obviously the basket of things that |
| 63:30 | are acceptable and unacceptable change |
| 63:32 | and EB and flow through time but really |
| 63:36 | it's it's uh you know I'm I'm a creature |
| 63:37 | of my time I'm going to I'm going to |
| 63:39 | tell these jokes and if they get big |
| 63:40 | laughs then then great have you always |
| 63:43 | had this perspective or is this |
| 63:44 | something that's developed like a muscle |
| 63:46 | over time no I think I think there's um |
| 63:48 | I think that adversity I've been |
| 63:50 | canceled quite a few times and there's I |
| 63:53 | try and see the positives in life right |
| 63:54 | so adversity is a filter and you find |
| 63:57 | out who your friends are and who stands |
| 63:59 | by you and who's you know who's ride or |
| 64:02 | die great turns out got loads of great |
| 64:05 | friends and a couple of people fell by |
| 64:07 | the wayside and great I don't have to |
| 64:10 | waste any time on them |
| 64:12 | because everyone loves you when you're |
| 64:13 | thrown a party but in the tough times |
| 64:16 | you're a bit more difficult to love and |
| 64:19 | if people stand by you then then they're |
| 64:21 | friends that's that's that's what it is |
| 64:23 | you friendship is such an important |
| 64:24 | thing it's something that we don't |
| 64:25 | really think about we think about a lot |
| 64:27 | about our partners in life and our |
| 64:29 | children and that side of family |
| 64:31 | friendship for me is such an important |
| 64:33 | thing it's such a huge part of my life |
| 64:35 | and really when you think about it why |
| 64:37 | why do why is comedy having this moment |
| 64:39 | well because comedian it's a little bit |
| 64:41 | like a friendship right there's there's |
| 64:42 | a there's no |
| 64:43 | filter and really your best friend is |
| 64:46 | the person you have the least filter |
| 64:47 | with your deepest darkest you share |
| 64:50 | you're open and a colleague you quite a |
| 64:53 | lot of filter and someone you meet the |
| 64:54 | bus stop |
| 64:56 | tons of filter right Comics kind there's |
| 64:58 | no there's no filter you see Chappelle |
| 65:01 | on stage he's it's him great you see |
| 65:04 | Chris Rock On Stage that's him it's like |
| 65:07 | you feel |
| 65:09 | connected |
| 65:10 | lovely there's really something in that |
| 65:13 | idea of as you were saying there that |
| 65:16 | there's so little authenticity and |
| 65:18 | vulnerability and openness in the world |
| 65:19 | that when we encounter it we feel so |
| 65:22 | connected to it because it caters to the |
| 65:25 | demand that we have that's not being met |
| 65:27 | with Supply there's so much supply of |
| 65:29 | like filter girl on holiday in Hawaii |
| 65:31 | drinking cocktail but it but in our sort |
| 65:34 | of private and our secret lives there's |
| 65:35 | very little um reflection of what we |
| 65:39 | think about in our private and secret |
| 65:40 | lives in the world so when we hear |
| 65:42 | someone talking about their depression |
| 65:44 | or their mental health we go oh my God |
| 65:45 | that you know can resonate or is this |
| 65:47 | not why the podcast is so big why comedy |
| 65:49 | so big at the moment because the the gap |
| 65:51 | between public and private discourse has |
| 65:53 | never been wider and we both were we're |
| 65:55 | both living in that space we go yeah |
| 65:58 | have a have a real conversation with |
| 65:59 | someone great and the you know the the |
| 66:02 | cancelling thing is is great but |
| 66:05 | really what happens I mean you could you |
| 66:07 | can recalibrate it and just call it free |
| 66:08 | publicity like people are talking about |
| 66:10 | you well great |
| 66:11 | okay there's this thing called the |
| 66:13 | Eraser test which one of my guests |
| 66:14 | talked to me about before mord out where |
| 66:16 | he said if you could go back and he |
| 66:17 | asked I think he asked or there was a |
| 66:19 | study done where they asked people if |
| 66:20 | they could go back in time and erase |
| 66:22 | their most difficult moment would you |
| 66:23 | press the button and erase it and like |
| 66:25 | these are like really traumatic events |
| 66:27 | about 95% of people said they wouldn't |
| 66:29 | when you think about your most traumatic |
| 66:30 | moments of sort of being canceled or |
| 66:32 | something like that the best best advice |
| 66:34 | I got um actually the last time I got |
| 66:36 | canceled I found a friend of mine who's |
| 66:37 | been cancelled and he said you've only |
| 66:41 | got you've only got to answer one |
| 66:43 | question who's Jimmy |
| 66:48 | car uh any went no who's Jimmy KH I well |
| 66:52 | I'm edgy stand-up comedian |
| 66:57 | okay fine then you haven't got a |
| 67:02 | problem it's great and then another |
| 67:05 | friend of mine just went well you need |
| 67:06 | to just rightsize this and I'm what |
| 67:09 | what's you've got to rightsize it she |
| 67:12 | said what's happened here you told a |
| 67:15 | joke and some people didn't like |
| 67:19 | it yeah that's what |
| 67:22 | happened I didn't didn't seem like that |
| 67:25 | a deal when you put it like |
| 67:27 | that and yet in the moment sometimes it |
| 67:29 | feels you know |
| 67:31 | catastrophic but those hard times you |
| 67:33 | know you wouldn't erased the hard times |
| 67:35 | because again I would say and it's a |
| 67:37 | it's a you can't have an easy life in a |
| 67:39 | great character and what they're saying |
| 67:41 | thereby not erasing that moment is I'll |
| 67:42 | keep my character |
| 67:44 | thanks anxiety we talked about this last |
| 67:47 | time anxiety is it's a very interesting |
| 67:50 | thing I mean my kind of original thought |
| 67:52 | on anxiety was the it's the flip side of |
| 67:55 | Crea ity so you have a mind that is |
| 67:57 | woring and that's given me every gift |
| 67:59 | I've ever received right the ability to |
| 68:01 | write jokes and to to be funny or |
| 68:02 | whatever is from that I can't turn it |
| 68:05 | off mind and sometimes at 4 in the |
| 68:07 | morning when you got nothing to do that |
| 68:08 | mind is still woring so you get involved |
| 68:11 | in counterfactuals you start to think of |
| 68:13 | all the other things that could have |
| 68:14 | happened that haven't happened in life |
| 68:16 | and you know people are not worried |
| 68:18 | about falling off a cliff they're |
| 68:20 | worried about jumping it's the madness |
| 68:24 | within all of us of like well what what |
| 68:25 | could happen and the worst case scenario |
| 68:27 | and these terrible things and you allow |
| 68:29 | that to to get ahead of you I think the |
| 68:31 | cure for it for me at the moment how I'm |
| 68:33 | managing my anxiety is giving myself |
| 68:35 | more to |
| 68:36 | do because I think anxiety you're trying |
| 68:38 | to solve a problem in the future now and |
| 68:42 | you can't because there's no problem in |
| 68:44 | the now the problem is in in the future |
| 68:48 | so you you you're kind of ahead there |
| 68:50 | trying to trying to figure out something |
| 68:53 | because you there's a demand |
| 68:56 | for um for problem solving in the moment |
| 68:58 | and you don't have a problem fact think |
| 69:01 | of like people don't get depressed when |
| 69:02 | they go to the gym right if you're in |
| 69:03 | the gym you can't be anxious while |
| 69:05 | you're working out because you have an |
| 69:07 | immediate problem I got lift this damn |
| 69:09 | thing off my chest you've got an |
| 69:10 | immediate thing to deal with you're in |
| 69:12 | that moment so it's hard to be anxious |
| 69:14 | because you got something to do right |
| 69:15 | now so give yourself something to do |
| 69:18 | right now if you're suffering with |
| 69:20 | anxiety and don't let your mind kind of |
| 69:22 | drift into the future kind I suppose |
| 69:24 | it's quite sort of um |
| 69:26 | Buddhist in a way is your anxiety |
| 69:28 | triggered by |
| 69:30 | anything or is it just kind of a noise |
| 69:33 | in the background I I don't think it is |
| 69:34 | I think you often I think I I think |
| 69:37 | there's an illusion that when you feel |
| 69:39 | anxiety it's about this thing I think |
| 69:42 | actually you've just got a a level of |
| 69:44 | anxiety and you will you know so if I've |
| 69:47 | got nothing to worry about career-wise |
| 69:48 | or show wise or I'm not currently being |
| 69:51 | canceled you might worry about the |
| 69:54 | environment or you worry about your kids |
| 69:56 | or you worry about you know you'll worry |
| 69:57 | about something else so I think you just |
| 70:00 | it just it attaches onto whatever's |
| 70:02 | front of mind and you logically go oh |
| 70:04 | it's anxiety about this it isn't it's |
| 70:05 | just |
| 70:07 | anxiety do you think people know who you |
| 70:09 | are truly you know I I met with a CIA |
| 70:12 | agent a couple of weeks ago and he said |
| 70:14 | we have three lives we have our our |
| 70:15 | secret life we have our private life and |
| 70:17 | then we have our public life public life |
| 70:18 | is you know the guy in the suit on |
| 70:20 | camera your private life might be what |
| 70:21 | your wife knows but then maybe your |
| 70:23 | secret life is who you are when there's |
| 70:25 | like absolutely nobody there in your |
| 70:27 | mind and in your own space do you think |
| 70:30 | people know who you are I think so I |
| 70:32 | think actually weirdly um this podcast |
| 70:35 | is quite important in that you know |
| 70:36 | going on this going on Joe Rogan going |
| 70:38 | on Modern wisdom and talking as myself |
| 70:41 | is very exposing uh and writing the book |
| 70:44 | before and after which is kind of a um |
| 70:46 | autobiography but also a bit |
| 70:48 | self-helpy-ness |
| 70:55 | if we knew each other if we were having |
| 70:56 | lunch you know for the listeners it's |
| 70:58 | like this is yeah it's kind of what I'm |
| 70:59 | like and then I've got an ability to be |
| 71:01 | funny on stage which is another side of |
| 71:03 | me so I think that's like it's not it's |
| 71:06 | not inauthentic what I do on stage it's |
| 71:07 | just like that's who I am in front of |
| 71:09 | 3,000 people that have all paid £30 to |
| 71:11 | be |
| 71:12 | entertained here we go what's the side |
| 71:14 | of view that your wife might know but we |
| 71:15 | don't well this this this is yeah you |
| 71:20 | know you you're slightly more um I think |
| 71:22 | on this it's it's very much you take |
| 71:24 | down the |
| 71:26 | uh it's not like doing a TV show to |
| 71:29 | publicize something so if you go on you |
| 71:32 | know gr you're very much like okay well |
| 71:33 | I've got three anecdotes and I'll get |
| 71:34 | them out and I'll try and get four |
| 71:35 | laughs and then I'll try and snipe her |
| 71:37 | in on the other guests and be funny and |
| 71:40 | it's a it's very performative whereas |
| 71:43 | this is performative but in a slightly |
| 71:44 | different way where you're kind of going |
| 71:45 | well this is kind of what I think about |
| 71:46 | the world and this is this is what it's |
| 71:48 | like inside my head and it's quite I |
| 71:51 | don't know I suppose when you step back |
| 71:52 | from it it's kind of okay well a lot of |
| 71:55 | self-help a lot of uh a lot of |
| 71:59 | uh I guess therapy a you that's that's |
| 72:03 | what I'm like since we spoke last |
| 72:06 | time is there anything you thought then |
| 72:09 | that you no longer believe I'm |
| 72:11 | interested I'm asking that question |
| 72:12 | because my favorite question what was |
| 72:13 | the last thing you changed your mind |
| 72:15 | about um I think I've changed my mind |
| 72:17 | about environmentalism a little bit I |
| 72:20 | think I'm I absolutely acknowledge the |
| 72:23 | problem and I think the solution is just |
| 72:25 | there I think it's I think it's |
| 72:26 | splitting the atom I think we should all |
| 72:28 | be I think nuclear is kind of the is the |
| 72:31 | future that's what we should be |
| 72:32 | investing in that's we've got an issue |
| 72:35 | that we have a system that is full of |
| 72:38 | politicians and we we haven't got |
| 72:42 | Statesmen we need longer |
| 72:44 | terms longer terms we need longer terms |
| 72:47 | because we need people to make decisions |
| 72:49 | like everything's about um about rewards |
| 72:53 | right so what do we reward it's on a 5 |
| 72:55 | year cycle so no one's ever going to |
| 72:57 | invest in nuclear because it's going to |
| 72:58 | take 20 years to pay off but they should |
| 73:01 | be rewarded for that somehow we need to |
| 73:03 | find a way to reward politicians for |
| 73:07 | what they did 20 years ago because if we |
| 73:09 | do that it's there there's a better |
| 73:11 | future right and I I don't know if |
| 73:14 | Britain doing it makes any difference |
| 73:16 | like people often say well if Britain |
| 73:18 | does it it doesn't make any difference |
| 73:20 | because well China's not going to do it |
| 73:21 | or India's not going to do it but you go |
| 73:22 | well actually if we did it if we did |
| 73:24 | something something radical and went all |
| 73:28 | nuclear there been incredible examples |
| 73:31 | to set to the rest of the world here's |
| 73:33 | what I do here's my you want to hear my |
| 73:34 | pitch all right here's my political |
| 73:36 | pitch right nuclear submarines have been |
| 73:38 | testing this for 50 years they're |
| 73:39 | perfectly safe right people going to |
| 73:41 | live in a nuclear sub next to the |
| 73:42 | reactor they're fine right so we build |
| 73:45 | one of those there's no not in my |
| 73:46 | backyard we put it in everyone's |
| 73:47 | backyard there's a nuclear reactor like |
| 73:50 | a submarine in every city bury it have a |
| 73:52 | small power unit in every city City and |
| 73:55 | town in Britain okay and then it's quite |
| 73:58 | expensive so you pay your fuel Bill and |
| 74:00 | in 20 years time we don't worry about |
| 74:01 | cop 23 we we burn all the fossil fuels |
| 74:04 | we want for 20 years and then in one day |
| 74:06 | we go totally green right no more fossil |
| 74:08 | fuels well a little bit for fertilizers |
| 74:10 | and stuff but no more essentially and |
| 74:12 | then fuel over the next 10 years uh |
| 74:15 | Power becomes |
| 74:17 | free so we say to businesses around the |
| 74:20 | world you want to set up a business in |
| 74:21 | Britain it's quite expensive to employ |
| 74:22 | people but Energy's free you think we |
| 74:25 | live in a world where energy will be of |
| 74:26 | value in 20 years |
| 74:28 | time is it going to be the thing yes so |
| 74:32 | you say to your Amazon and your Googles |
| 74:34 | do you want to set up the place here |
| 74:35 | yeah |
| 74:36 | great if I rule the world that's what I |
| 74:38 | would do Trump's probably going to come |
| 74:40 | back into Power isn't he by the looks of |
| 74:42 | things Biden's not doesn't seem to be |
| 74:43 | very compelling to people according to |
| 74:44 | some of the polls I mean a week is a |
| 74:46 | long time in politics who knows who |
| 74:48 | knows what will happen I think America |
| 74:50 | will be fine regardless America is um |
| 74:54 | Geographic rically economically uh it's |
| 74:57 | a net exporter of fuel and of food it's |
| 75:01 | got incredible Neighbors in Canada and |
| 75:03 | Mexico it is it's going to have the most |
| 75:06 | incredible 20 years regardless of who |
| 75:08 | gets in they're going to double their |
| 75:11 | industrial base in the next 20 years |
| 75:13 | because everything that was globalized |
| 75:16 | is becoming more insula uh which isn't |
| 75:18 | necessarily good for the world but very |
| 75:19 | good for America America can afford to |
| 75:21 | have a terrible political system because |
| 75:23 | it is so blessed |
| 75:25 | they're going to own much of the AI race |
| 75:27 | as well all the big AI companies seem to |
| 75:28 | be based in America and that feel feels |
| 75:30 | like that's going to really I'm not |
| 75:32 | worried about Ai No AI is a covers band |
| 75:36 | it's it's artificial intelligence it's |
| 75:38 | not artificial Consciousness right so if |
| 75:40 | you tell it to write a joke it can spit |
| 75:42 | back stuff that you've already written |
| 75:43 | and reorder it slightly but yeah don't |
| 75:47 | worry about it but if you imagine the |
| 75:48 | Beatles aren't worried about the bootleg |
| 75:49 | Beatles but if you imagine at sort of |
| 75:52 | even a 20% rate of improvement every |
| 75:54 | year it's it's only going to take and |
| 75:56 | you know that compounds it's only going |
| 75:57 | to take us five or 10 years before |
| 75:58 | there's a [ __ ] AI that can crack a |
| 76:01 | joke really really [ __ ] well great |
| 76:04 | and and an original |
| 76:06 | joke I don't know whether it's going to |
| 76:07 | be original I think there is something |
| 76:09 | about I mean uh you know I don't know |
| 76:12 | genius is an over overused term right so |
| 76:14 | there's there's uh there's two types of |
| 76:16 | Genius right there's there's um there's |
| 76:19 | innate actual genius there's you know |
| 76:22 | bark or bethoven or whatever you know |
| 76:24 | genius genius and then there's um hyper |
| 76:27 | accelerated |
| 76:29 | rationality and it's kind of what you |
| 76:31 | know people talk about comic genius and |
| 76:32 | they go that's what they're talking |
| 76:33 | about hyper accelerated rationality and |
| 76:36 | I think AI is a long way from either of |
| 76:39 | them like of coming up generating |
| 76:41 | something that's genuinely |
| 76:43 | original no it's a covers band it can it |
| 76:47 | it can it can go well that's the genre |
| 76:49 | and I can do something that's a bit |
| 76:50 | similar but there's something about |
| 76:52 | human creativity that I don't think it's |
| 76:54 | getting close to |
| 76:55 | and maybe I'm being naive but I think |
| 76:58 | it'll be an incredible thing for the |
| 77:00 | world because I think new jobs will come |
| 77:04 | along this wasn't a job 10 years ago |
| 77:07 | right being a podcaster you tell someone |
| 77:09 | I'm going to do I'm going to do sort of |
| 77:10 | a long radio show but people but it's an |
| 77:13 | individual you'd have to explain it you |
| 77:16 | know it things change and it's only when |
| 77:19 | you sort of look back you go oh wow |
| 77:20 | that's interesting the biggest TV |
| 77:22 | channel in the world is YouTube |
| 77:25 | and no one noticed the BBC were battling |
| 77:28 | with ITV about who's going to get the |
| 77:30 | higher ratings on a Saturday night and |
| 77:32 | YouTube stole their lunch because they |
| 77:34 | weren't paying |
| 77:35 | attention is that not AI well it's the |
| 77:39 | world it's the world progresses and |
| 77:41 | things move on and it's always been fine |
| 77:44 | I think people worrying about AI it |
| 77:45 | really strikes me it's the people going |
| 77:47 | well these we've got to smash up these |
| 77:49 | these cotton making machines because |
| 77:51 | this is this is this can't happen |
| 77:53 | there'll be no new jobs they'll just be |
| 77:55 | different jobs I read a book called The |
| 77:56 | innovators dilemma and it really changed |
| 77:59 | my mind on a few things they go back |
| 78:00 | through history and they look at all of |
| 78:02 | the big steps forward in Innovation and |
| 78:04 | they basically categorize two types of |
| 78:06 | innovation I'll call it the upward |
| 78:07 | opportunity and the downward opportunity |
| 78:09 | so if you're selling horses back in the |
| 78:12 | 1880s the upward opportunity is the |
| 78:14 | thing that all your customers are asking |
| 78:15 | for it is the thing that you know how to |
| 78:17 | do it is the thing that you have your |
| 78:18 | supply chain setup to deliver on which |
| 78:20 | is faster and better horses you know you |
| 78:22 | can imagine the meeting that you're the |
| 78:24 | CEO of horse company I come in I go |
| 78:25 | listen boss got an idea they go what is |
| 78:27 | it I go faster horses you go people |
| 78:29 | asking for it I go yeah do we know how |
| 78:30 | to do it yeah um do we have a customer B |
| 78:33 | yeah let's do that then then another guy |
| 78:35 | comes in and says Jimmy I've got an idea |
| 78:37 | um cars are they better no you have to |
| 78:40 | walk in front of it with a red red flag |
| 78:41 | and it goes 10 miles an hour do we know |
| 78:43 | how to do it no is anyone asking for it |
| 78:46 | no one none of our customers have asked |
| 78:47 | for a horse yeah that is the downward |
| 78:49 | opportunity and throughout history the |
| 78:51 | incumbents always ignore the downward |
| 78:53 | opportunity because their incentives as |
| 78:55 | you said their incentives are set up to |
| 78:58 | pursue what we call the sustaining |
| 78:59 | Innovation the obvious thing in front of |
| 79:01 | them become a better comedian or become |
| 79:03 | a better podcaster get another camera |
| 79:05 | the downward opportunity I asked myself |
| 79:07 | what is the downward opportunity in |
| 79:08 | podcasting L you should ask uh you |
| 79:10 | should ask comedians comedians got an |
| 79:12 | interesting way of thinking I think |
| 79:13 | we're very similar to |
| 79:15 | detectives because we think backwards |
| 79:18 | most people think about what's next |
| 79:19 | right which is what you're talking about |
| 79:20 | there is what's next what's the next |
| 79:21 | thing what's the next thing and we go |
| 79:23 | well this is the state of affairs how |
| 79:25 | did this happen it's the same as it's |
| 79:27 | like being Sherlock Holmes you go how |
| 79:28 | the how the hell did that you kind of |
| 79:30 | you're reverse engineering a lot of the |
| 79:32 | time it's very interesting that this is |
| 79:34 | this may yet be a business |
| 79:38 | podcast I think I I honestly think with |
| 79:41 | the right amount of work if you really |
| 79:42 | put yourself into this I genuinely think |
| 79:44 | you can occasionally talk about |
| 79:46 | business I tried to I try and weave it |
| 79:48 | in where I can yeah but that's |
| 79:50 | interesting that the the podcast thing |
| 79:51 | of going no one saw podcast coming |
| 79:54 | nobody like this and yet what's missing |
| 79:56 | from our lives right what's what's |
| 79:58 | missing what's the nature of BS of |
| 80:00 | vacuum well people aren't having |
| 80:02 | conversations people are when you look |
| 80:04 | around the world all those people that |
| 80:05 | live to 100 all of those zones and |
| 80:07 | people go oh yeah they eat loads of |
| 80:09 | olive oil and fish maybe that's the |
| 80:10 | answer no it isn't they eat with other |
| 80:12 | people they have a conversation they're |
| 80:14 | part of a community that's the |
| 80:16 | difference they've got something to live |
| 80:18 | for the olive oil isn't making any |
| 80:21 | [ __ ] difference the connection to |
| 80:23 | other human beings is what are you doing |
| 80:25 | here you're connecting to people you're |
| 80:27 | having a conversation so people are |
| 80:28 | eavesdropping on a conversation but in |
| 80:30 | their heads they're having a |
| 80:31 | conversation and they're the stuff we're |
| 80:33 | talking about they're relating to their |
| 80:35 | lives great nobody was asking for this |
| 80:38 | though nobody was saying do you know |
| 80:39 | what I want three hours of Jimmy Carr |
| 80:42 | talking about life no one was like |
| 80:43 | demanding that in the like someone you |
| 80:45 | know someone roll rolling their eyes as |
| 80:48 | they listen to this yeah and I'm turning |
| 80:49 | off now but in that industry they |
| 80:51 | probably thought people want bigger TVs |
| 80:53 | and thinner TVs that's what they want |
| 80:54 | they want to watch the BBC on a thinner |
| 80:56 | bigger television so we're going to |
| 80:58 | deliver it to them whereas the the down |
| 81:00 | opportunity was in fact they wanted |
| 81:02 | connection they wanted it to be longer |
| 81:04 | form they didn't want loads of ads every |
| 81:06 | six seconds inside of it is this not the |
| 81:08 | great sort of if you're listening to |
| 81:10 | this and you're thinking right what am I |
| 81:11 | going to do it's like it's not like |
| 81:14 | someone has spotted the Gap in the |
| 81:15 | market you could be the person you know |
| 81:18 | and it's it's that thing of like do what |
| 81:19 | you do authentically um I I always think |
| 81:22 | like Joe Rogan's a really interesting |
| 81:24 | example of that of someone that's |
| 81:25 | entirely authentic what you talk about |
| 81:28 | comedy and MMA and life and slightly |
| 81:33 | kind of you |
| 81:34 | know philosophy stuff that he's |
| 81:36 | interested he's exactly the same guy he |
| 81:38 | was 20 years in The Comedy Store 20 |
| 81:40 | years ago in The Comedy Store back |
| 81:41 | backstage chatting he's exactly that guy |
| 81:45 | totally authentic and people just yeah |
| 81:49 | great I listen to that all day you're |
| 81:51 | exactly who you are I mean I love the |
| 81:53 | idea that you think there's still a bit |
| 81:54 | of you that thinks it's a business |
| 81:56 | podcast it's not it's not you re you |
| 81:59 | have a thing where you love stories and |
| 82:01 | you love chatting to people and you love |
| 82:03 | learning and that's what it is this is |
| 82:05 | just it's the this should be called the |
| 82:07 | education of Steven bartler well I the |
| 82:10 | reason I think this is a business |
| 82:11 | podcast is because of what I said I |
| 82:12 | think business is mental like this is |
| 82:14 | called The Diary of a CEO right what |
| 82:17 | would you find in the Diary of a CEO you |
| 82:18 | wouldn't find [ __ ] forecasts and pnls |
| 82:21 | would you you'd find problems with his |
| 82:22 | wife and you'd find that he's having anx |
| 82:24 | anxiety attacks and you'd find that he's |
| 82:26 | doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's doing so |
| 82:28 | the whole point of this was to go into |
| 82:29 | the Diary of a CEO the things you that's |
| 82:32 | not business that's the rest of his life |
| 82:36 | this is about life I mean I I love it I |
| 82:37 | absolutely love it I'm not breaking your |
| 82:39 | balls but it's like it's it's uh it's |
| 82:41 | it's great the way that it's kind of |
| 82:42 | developed I think yeah it's been led by |
| 82:46 | as you say curiosity I get people all |
| 82:47 | the time will say Steve we want the |
| 82:49 | [ __ ] CEOs back we want to listen to |
| 82:51 | the business people or whatever and I |
| 82:53 | just go you know I can't do that for a |
| 82:54 | decade what I can do for a decade is |
| 82:56 | follow my curiosity like I could do that |
| 82:58 | for the next 30 40 years and at some |
| 83:01 | point I'm going to care about a zmek and |
| 83:02 | I cared about psychedelics and so that's |
| 83:05 | what I'm going to talk about and if you |
| 83:06 | don't like it then there are three other |
| 83:08 | million other options yeah I think that |
| 83:11 | thing about that's going with your gut |
| 83:13 | is going to be the way to go because if |
| 83:16 | you like the show and if you're having |
| 83:17 | interest in conversations I think the |
| 83:19 | listener will will go with that and if |
| 83:21 | you try and give them what they wanted I |
| 83:24 | think again it's the it's exactly that |
| 83:25 | thing of going we need Better Faster |
| 83:27 | Horses not a car and you're going well |
| 83:29 | you need a car cuz whatever this is in |
| 83:31 | 10 years time it's going to be different |
| 83:33 | right it's going be it'll be something |
| 83:34 | I'll dad and I'll be thinking about a |
| 83:36 | different set of problems and I'll be |
| 83:37 | speaking to parental psychologists about |
| 83:39 | what Fu do with my kids and stuff yeah |
| 83:41 | um but Rogan was the blue I have to say |
| 83:44 | it and I think I've dm'd him it I don't |
| 83:45 | think he replied but I just said to him |
| 83:47 | one day that the blueprint he said about |
| 83:49 | authenticity and following whatever it |
| 83:51 | is you're interested in has helped me so |
| 83:53 | much because is there's more pressure to |
| 83:56 | change when there's more people watching |
| 83:59 | and they can I've seen petitions and |
| 84:01 | I've seen little movements on LinkedIn |
| 84:03 | trying to get me to have more of these |
| 84:04 | kind of people on the single biggest |
| 84:06 | request I have on this podcast is to |
| 84:08 | quote interview normal people that are |
| 84:11 | at the start of their Journey that's the |
| 84:12 | quote that's what they say to me um and |
| 84:16 | I go well if you'd interviewed Stephen |
| 84:18 | at |
| 84:20 | 18 yeah not a lot to talk about um you |
| 84:23 | know so it really be them interviewing |
| 84:25 | me maybe that tends to what happens who |
| 84:27 | would be the student in that situation |
| 84:29 | um but it's that's the most popular |
| 84:32 | request I get is to go and interview |
| 84:34 | quote unquote normal |
| 84:36 | people so yeah ignoring that I mean as |
| 84:39 | you must have been able had to ignore |
| 84:41 | the external pressure of changing or |
| 84:43 | telling a certain type of joke or being |
| 84:44 | a certain type of no I think I think I |
| 84:46 | think the audience though for me because |
| 84:48 | in that immediate feedback loop they do |
| 84:49 | tell me what they find funny and that |
| 84:52 | kind of leads you down the road of going |
| 84:54 | that's that's interesting people want to |
| 84:56 | hear this I think the reason people are |
| 84:57 | drawn to my comedy is partly because |
| 85:00 | there's not a lot of censorship in our |
| 85:01 | society there's quite a lot of self |
| 85:04 | censorship so people aren't speaking |
| 85:07 | freely in the office or even at home |
| 85:10 | they're not saying what they really |
| 85:11 | think if you notice this thing opinion |
| 85:13 | polls don't seem as accurate as they |
| 85:14 | once were and that's because people |
| 85:16 | don't feel like they don't vote in the |
| 85:19 | same way as they as they as they express |
| 85:23 | themselves in the world |
| 85:25 | so they come and see me live and there's |
| 85:27 | no filter and this guy's saying whatever |
| 85:29 | he wants this guy doesn't seem to give a |
| 85:30 | [ __ ] very |
| 85:32 | cathartic if you're spending your days |
| 85:34 | going well I know what the right thing |
| 85:36 | to say is so I'll say the right thing |
| 85:37 | you know if you want to see who has |
| 85:39 | power in a society who can't you |
| 85:41 | criticize and making jokes and making |
| 85:44 | light of all of that stuff is is |
| 85:46 | powerful because it it uh it's about |
| 85:49 | free speech and it's about um the |
| 85:51 | Overton window you know that Overton |
| 85:53 | window of what is and what isn't |
| 85:55 | acceptable to speak about you know so |
| 85:57 | there's an no window in politics of what |
| 85:59 | what is and what isn't acceptable policy |
| 86:02 | and then there's an overturn window of |
| 86:03 | what is and what isn't acceptable to |
| 86:04 | talk about in polite society and I think |
| 86:07 | comedy has a really valuable role in |
| 86:09 | moving that overturn window in what what |
| 86:11 | people can discuss what people can talk |
| 86:13 | about I'm always very interested in like |
| 86:15 | occasionally it happens where you'll |
| 86:17 | overhear the audience leaving a comedy |
| 86:19 | show and have such great |
| 86:21 | conversations it's really interesting |
| 86:23 | how it like just Taps into they just |
| 86:25 | feel a bit Freer and looser because |
| 86:28 | they've listened to someone on stage |
| 86:29 | being very loose and they're not button |
| 86:32 | down they're not trying to self-censor |
| 86:34 | or say the right |
| 86:35 | thing self- expression and expression |
| 86:37 | generally has just been on such a |
| 86:39 | journey like you know this whole idea of |
| 86:41 | wokeism and what you can and can't say |
| 86:43 | it's I mean it really accelerated in the |
| 86:45 | last 10 years to the point that it's |
| 86:47 | it's quite you know it's quite if I look |
| 86:49 | back at comedy videos from 20 years ago |
| 86:52 | they really seem to just be able to say |
| 86:53 | whatever the [ __ ] they wanted to say and |
| 86:55 | then we went through this era of like |
| 86:57 | censorship and cancellation and there's |
| 87:00 | no time in human history where the good |
| 87:02 | guys have censored |
| 87:04 | stuff it's never happened so wherever |
| 87:08 | that's coming from whether it's the |
| 87:09 | right you know the marry White House ban |
| 87:11 | this filth which used to be the case or |
| 87:14 | the left the idea that the there's um |
| 87:17 | you know a hate speech or or the idea |
| 87:20 | that something could be words can be |
| 87:22 | violence um which is you know what |
| 87:25 | people say when they've never |
| 87:26 | experienced real violence I guess um the |
| 87:29 | there's such demand for violence we had |
| 87:30 | to we had to co-opt words into it but |
| 87:33 | the idea of going this you're trying to |
| 87:35 | censor stuff is is a bad idea free |
| 87:37 | speech is a very good idea because those |
| 87:39 | thoughts don't go away if people don't |
| 87:42 | express themselves they just get they |
| 87:43 | get suppressed and and actually just |
| 87:45 | speaking freely about stuff and talking |
| 87:47 | about it is is very very valuable when |
| 87:50 | you're trying to build something the |
| 87:51 | problem that we all face is we need to |
| 87:54 | talent and skills that we don't have |
| 87:56 | ourselves and we can waste so much time |
| 87:59 | trying to learn a new skill when really |
| 88:01 | what we should be doing is using a |
| 88:03 | platform like fiverr.com where you have |

| 88:17 | when I was starting out in business was |
| 88:18 | a real unlock it was a bit of a hack |

| 88:22 | way for me to add skills to to my |

| 88:53 | something I think about a lot where are |
| 88:54 | my limits because I get a lot of |
| 88:55 | messages saying would you have this |
| 88:56 | person on would you speak to Trump would |
| 88:58 | you speak to Vladimir Putin would you |
| 89:00 | speak to you know yeah I mean I think I |
| 89:02 | think you're I think you have to speak |
| 89:04 | to everyone I think the idea of going |
| 89:07 | that there's there's people that are |
| 89:08 | beyond the pale people have got like |
| 89:10 | there's people with bad ideas right I |
| 89:11 | don't know if there's that many bad |
| 89:12 | people but there's bad incentives and |
| 89:14 | people that follow them and talking to |
| 89:17 | everyone seems incredibly valuable to me |
| 89:19 | and the idea that you go yeah that's how |
| 89:21 | life moves forward you know there's you |
| 89:23 | know even you want to be a Marxist it's |
| 89:25 | a dialectic of going well this person I |
| 89:27 | don't agree with and you have the |
| 89:28 | conversation and with an open mind and |
| 89:31 | an open heart and maybe you change their |
| 89:32 | mind and how do you move the |
| 89:34 | conversation forward I mean the great |
| 89:35 | mystery for me in politics is the idea |
| 89:37 | that people talk about um Hypocrites in |
| 89:40 | politics changing their mind about |
| 89:44 | things of course he changed his mind the |
| 89:46 | facts have changed that the world's |
| 89:48 | changed you move |
| 89:50 | on Obama ran on an anti-gay marriage |
| 89:53 | ticket |
| 89:55 | but the world moves on and things |
| 89:57 | progress and you know I'm I'm you know a |
| 90:00 | progressive but I think the idea of not |
| 90:03 | listening to people is poison you you |
| 90:06 | think about why Hillary lost the |
| 90:09 | election right it was that deplorables |
| 90:11 | thing remember when she talked about the |
| 90:13 | deplorables and you can't talk to those |
| 90:16 | people and it was like no those are |
| 90:18 | those are just working class people and |
| 90:20 | they've got they've got worries and you |
| 90:23 | need to talk to them about those worries |
| 90:25 | you can't just write them all off and go |
| 90:27 | well they're despicable people you know |
| 90:29 | that Urban Elite kind of thing you've |
| 90:31 | got to bring them in have the |
| 90:33 | conversation you'll get someone with it |
| 90:36 | you you know you have to listen to that |
| 90:37 | you have to listen to all the different |
| 90:39 | sides of the argument otherwise we're |
| 90:41 | entrenched we're just in these little |
| 90:43 | you know and it's it's that thing of |
| 90:45 | like it becomes uh identity you know |
| 90:49 | which party that you follow crazy people |
| 90:51 | don't like to follow people that they |
| 90:52 | disagree with online in particular |
| 90:54 | because that's creating cognitive |
| 90:55 | dissonance isn't it it's a constant |
| 90:57 | confrontation of a set of ideas that |
| 91:00 | threaten or challenge you in some way so |
| 91:01 | we'd rather just create this little Echo |
| 91:03 | chamber of individuals that will confirm |
| 91:06 | my set my set of existing beliefs and |
| 91:08 | that's what you know one of the things I |
| 91:09 | I made the decision to do about two |
| 91:11 | three years ago was just to follow |
| 91:12 | everyone that I am viscerally sort of |
| 91:15 | repulsed by should I say yeah and if you |
| 91:18 | had them on the show if you had people |
| 91:19 | on the show that you go I don't really |
| 91:20 | agree with what they say but yes yeah |
| 91:23 | it's I I feel like great to be back |
| 91:27 | yeah the uh that's interesting I think |
| 91:29 | that's really I think that's really |
| 91:30 | valuable I think that's a more |
| 91:31 | interesting conversation as well because |
| 91:33 | if you're just going to nod along with |
| 91:35 | someone and go well it's talking sense |
| 91:37 | that's great it's like you know and it I |
| 91:40 | think to have those kind of difficult |
| 91:41 | conversations is really it's a valuable |
| 91:43 | thing one thing you said which surprised |
| 91:45 | me because it didn't come at all up at |
| 91:48 | all in our previous conversation at all |
| 91:50 | and even in my prior research was you |
| 91:53 | said that you feel like you have a |
| 91:54 | lowlevel eating |
| 91:55 | disorder yeah I think I'm very uh very |
| 91:58 | conscious of my uh weight and my |
| 92:02 | appearance and I think that's |
| 92:04 | maybe uh Eating Disorders are very |
| 92:07 | they're very very serious things and I'm |
| 92:09 | not um I'm not really in that category |
| 92:11 | but I'm very aware of it like as a as a |
| 92:13 | man as well I was chatting to um Chris |
| 92:16 | Williamson on about this on uh modern |
| 92:18 | wisdom I think I think he was like |
| 92:20 | quoting the stat of saying men's uh body |
| 92:23 | morphia overtakes women's I think in the |
| 92:25 | next year in terms of kind of young men |
| 92:29 | looking at Instagram wanting to look a |
| 92:30 | certain way and presenting themselves a |
| 92:31 | certain way I think there there is kind |
| 92:33 | of an issue around it I think that weird |
| 92:35 | thing about like I've had a bit of work |
| 92:36 | done you know and had my teeth done and |
| 92:40 | my hair done and I think there is kind |
| 92:42 | of a there's something about being on |
| 92:44 | screen all the time that you get very |
| 92:47 | conscious of kind of uh and maybe it's |
| 92:49 | slightly a control thing have you always |
| 92:51 | had that um or is it developed I think |
| 92:54 | it's kind I think it's slightly |
| 92:54 | developed through sort of you know I |
| 92:57 | think if I wasn't on TV or on Netflix or |
| 92:59 | whatever I think you probably wouldn't |
| 93:00 | be as aware of how you how you present |
| 93:04 | yourself um so it's it's it's slightly |
| 93:07 | odd like thing slightly odd relationship |
| 93:10 | with I mean I I have kind of a theory |
| 93:14 | around um around drugs right drugs and |
| 93:19 | alcohol so I think marijuana when you |
| 93:21 | think about it like weed |
| 93:24 | uh is people are very Carefree about H |
| 93:27 | well that's just a bit of weed fine but |
| 93:30 | think about what it is right it's not an |
| 93:32 | performance-enhancing drug it's a |
| 93:34 | performance inhibiting drug right it |
| 93:36 | takes away your ambition and agency and |
| 93:40 | it just makes you very chilled and |
| 93:42 | relaxed and I don't think that's |
| 93:44 | appropriate for men in their 20s or |
| 93:48 | teenagers right actually what you want |
| 93:51 | is the performance and aring and I think |
| 93:52 | what we should be s promoting is almost |
| 93:54 | like prohibition I mean I did it kind of |
| 93:57 | organically I found comedy and I gave up |
| 93:59 | drinking for 12 years I didn't touch a |
| 94:02 | drop and that was mainly because of |
| 94:04 | Lifestyle because I was driving to gigs |
| 94:07 | and driving back and then I didn't want |
| 94:08 | to hang over the next day because I I |
| 94:11 | wanted to and everyone was trying to buy |
| 94:12 | you drinks all the time and it just felt |
| 94:13 | like it was like enough already I'm |
| 94:16 | going to be I'm going to be straight |
| 94:17 | edge which I always like the term |
| 94:18 | straight edge it's a punk rock term for |
| 94:21 | being T tootal straight edge it's cooler |
| 94:24 | right |
| 94:25 | mhm but I like the idea of going right |
| 94:27 | I'm going to control that I mean I drink |
| 94:29 | a little bit now kind of socially but uh |
| 94:32 | not in a problem way but giving up was |
| 94:34 | quite an important |
| 94:35 | thing because it was also the focus that |
| 94:38 | it gives you so I don't know I I kind of |
| 94:40 | I'm slightly uh slightly anti-drugs for |
| 94:43 | young people I slightly think men in |
| 94:45 | their 50s and 60s that that are |
| 94:47 | Workaholics maybe some marijuana |
| 94:49 | wouldn't be a bad |
| 94:51 | idea but it's the it's the idea of kind |
| 94:53 | of young people taking it and not having |
| 94:56 | it's what does it take from you takes |
| 94:58 | away that kind of that that raw ambition |
| 95:01 | and that's as such a sort of valuable |
| 95:03 | thing in those years it's almost like |
| 95:05 | that advantage that young people can't |
| 95:07 | see the advantage that they have they |
| 95:10 | see the the the the wealth uh and the |
| 95:14 | you know the financial um security of |
| 95:17 | being 50 and when you're 20 what you |
| 95:20 | don't recognize is the energy that you |
| 95:21 | have when you're 20 that Inc inredible |
| 95:24 | Advantage you have over everyone else in |
| 95:26 | the office in that you're |
| 95:28 | just you're just full of energy your 20 |
| 95:31 | years older than me exactly what advice |
| 95:33 | would you give to me that's unobvious as |
| 95:35 | a 31y old you're 51 I believe yeah what |
| 95:38 | advice would you give to me that's would |
| 95:40 | be probably quite unobvious to me at my |
| 95:42 | age about the next sort of 20 years of |
| 95:44 | my life stay out the |
| 95:47 | sun stay out the sun sun damage is is |
| 95:50 | 90% of Aging stay out the sun honestly |
| 95:52 | you'll save a fortune plastic |
| 95:54 | surgeon uh the uh I don't know I mean I |
| 95:58 | think that you know I don't know if you |
| 96:00 | could be in a better place right now |
| 96:03 | than you are but you can certainly give |
| 96:05 | yourself gifts when you're 50 what gifts |
| 96:08 | do you want to give yourself let's talk |
| 96:10 | about what gifts you would like to |
| 96:11 | receive on your 51st birthday from |
| 96:16 | you interesting what would you like to |
| 96:19 | have I'd like to be physically fit so |
| 96:22 | done no problem at all you will need to |
| 96:25 | go to the gym three times a week and 80% |
| 96:28 | of it is going to be diet not exercise |
| 96:32 | okay so you're going to need to do that |
| 96:34 | but no problem at all I'm the genie you |
| 96:37 | got it what else would you like I would |
| 96:39 | like a happy healthy family and |
| 96:41 | relationship with my partner I'd like to |
| 96:43 | be married and I'd like her to be happy |
| 96:46 | and I'd like my kids to be happy |
| 96:49 | okay that's great I don't think you get |
| 96:52 | to call that |
| 96:54 | I think you get to be happy and you're |
| 96:56 | in charge of that and their happiness is |
| 96:59 | maybe a byproduct of that but you need I |
| 97:02 | I my perception would be you need the |
| 97:04 | locus of control to be within you you |
| 97:07 | could be happy make yourself happy and |
| 97:09 | that's good for the people around you |
| 97:11 | but I don't think someone else's |
| 97:12 | happiness can be your responsibility I |
| 97:14 | you can set up all the conditions and |
| 97:16 | you can you can make it as easy as you |
| 97:18 | can |
| 97:19 | but you know that's that's that's a lot |
| 97:21 | but but I get the idea of it there |
| 97:24 | how many kids four four Jesus Christ all |
| 97:29 | right so four four kids so you're you're |
| 97:31 | in minivan territory already you can't |
| 97:32 | even drive a regular car this is crazy |
| 97:35 | this is |
| 97:35 | madness um four kids so one of each one |
| 97:38 | of each yeah a modern |
| 97:40 | world uh I love that all right what else |
| 97:43 | would you what else would you want in 20 |
| 97:44 | years time I'd like to still be doing a |
| 97:45 | business podcast you're not doing a |
| 97:47 | business podcast now very little |
| 97:50 | business in this no one ever talks about |
| 97:52 | supply and demand |
| 97:54 | nonsense um I think yeah the the that |
| 97:58 | stoic thing of like you still doing this |
| 97:59 | in 20 years time what a journey that |
| 98:01 | will |
| 98:02 | be like think about the people that you |
| 98:05 | will speak to think about the things |
| 98:06 | that you will learn think about the the |
| 98:08 | road that you're on and and actually if |
| 98:09 | you're open to speaking to everyone then |
| 98:12 | the Comm the lines of communication are |
| 98:14 | kept open and that's incredibly |
| 98:16 | important in the modern world where |
| 98:18 | people are uh uh uh in these you know |
| 98:21 | divided camps it's |
| 98:24 | important what gifts were most important |
| 98:27 | for you when you turned |
| 98:28 | 50 that you either had or hadn't given |
| 98:31 | yourself when you turned 50 you know you |
| 98:33 | look around on your your 50th birthday |
| 98:35 | about the gifts that you either have or |
| 98:37 | that you wish you had what are those |
| 98:39 | things I was in Australia last year on |
| 98:41 | tour and |
| 98:44 | I fairly arbitrarily I mean I was always |
| 98:46 | very good at trying new material and |
| 98:48 | doing sort of warm-up gigs and I just |
| 98:50 | went oh I'm going to try something new |
| 98:52 | I'm going to do new [ __ ] at at every |
| 98:53 | show I'm going to try I'm going to write |
| 98:55 | jokes during the day and then I'll try |
| 98:57 | them that night at every single |
| 98:59 | show and a year later I've got a new |
| 99:04 | show and it was so easy to put together |
| 99:07 | because it was just like every night |
| 99:09 | you're you're you're trying new new new |
| 99:11 | new and it forces you into that space of |
| 99:14 | writing more and more more and more and |
| 99:17 | I feel like I'm getting better you know |
| 99:19 | a year on you go that was yeah that was |
| 99:23 | that was easy and it was just little and |
| 99:26 | often how important is that the the |
| 99:29 | routines you know the small things |
| 99:31 | because I think there's kind of two |
| 99:32 | camps of people typically there's those |
| 99:33 | that think sweating the small stuff |
| 99:35 | matters and there's those that think |
| 99:37 | sweating the small stuff is |
| 99:39 | inconsequential and it's you know but it |
| 99:42 | seems that you know the people that I |
| 99:44 | seem to sit here with that are really |
| 99:46 | successful at what they do have a real |
| 99:48 | obsession with the detail I remember I |
| 99:50 | don't know if it's the small stuff I |
| 99:52 | think it's the important stuff |
| 99:54 | so I wouldn't swear anything other than |
| 99:55 | the joke writing and the performing on |
| 99:58 | stage everything else it's all small |
| 100:02 | stuff that's the important stuff and |
| 100:04 | focusing on that like knowing what's |
| 100:05 | important I guess would be the first |
| 100:07 | stage there but then yeah that's that |
| 100:09 | seems absolutely critical remember I sat |
| 100:11 | here with Walter isacon who followed |
| 100:12 | Elon Musk for two years and followed |
| 100:14 | Steve Jobs for two years before Steve |
| 100:15 | Jobs died um both two business people |
| 100:18 | he's not connected though no one thinks |
| 100:19 | it's his |
| 100:20 | fault no you're not you're not casting |
| 100:22 | any no no I'm not saying he did I'm not |
| 100:24 | saying he did but he said something to |
| 100:25 | me about how Steve Jobs would even make |
| 100:28 | the circuit board inside the iPhone look |
| 100:30 | beautiful and this came from Steve Jobs |
| 100:33 | father who who told him that he had to |
| 100:35 | paint the back of the fence as well even |
| 100:37 | though no one would ever see the back of |
| 100:38 | the fence because it was covered but he |
| 100:40 | said that truly great individuals care |
| 100:42 | equally about the parts that are unseen |
| 100:45 | you know the things you'll never see and |
| 100:46 | I always that's incredible that Steve |
| 100:48 | Jobs would care so much about making the |
| 100:50 | the circuit board inside this iPhone |
| 100:52 | look beautiful |
| 100:54 | and why is he doing that well is he |
| 100:55 | doing that because he will know you know |
| 100:58 | and I and that made me think about this |
| 100:59 | concept of your self story we have you |
| 101:02 | said reputation earlier which is the |
| 101:03 | external story of what people think of |
| 101:05 | you but everything we do writes this |
| 101:07 | self story about who I like when you |
| 101:09 | leave I I love this concept the idea |
| 101:11 | that we are a story We Tell ourselves |
| 101:12 | yeah and everything I'm doing is telling |
| 101:14 | me who I am so Chris Eubank Jr the the |
| 101:16 | son of the famous boxer Great boxer |
| 101:18 | himself says that he if he's on a |
| 101:20 | treadmill and he gets cramp in his leg |
| 101:22 | like really painful cramp in his leg no |
| 101:24 | one's in the gym but he told himself he |
| 101:26 | was going to do 20 km he says I I will |
| 101:29 | physically limp the last 8K yeah even |
| 101:32 | though no one's there of course why of |
| 101:35 | course because you you are who you who |
| 101:39 | you who you are like that's that how you |
| 101:41 | do anything is how you do |
| 101:44 | everything so he's all in he's he's that |
| 101:47 | guy great that's it's great that's a |
| 101:50 | good that's a great story because you go |
| 101:52 | yes well of course of course if you say |
| 101:54 | you're going to do it and then you're |
| 101:55 | the kind of person that does the thing |
| 101:57 | you |
| 101:58 | say it's powerful right if you keep a |
| 102:00 | little promise to yourself that's |
| 102:02 | powerful that changes your sort of |
| 102:04 | perception of self you can trust |
| 102:06 | yourself a little bit |
| 102:07 | more a lot of us pathologically let let |
| 102:09 | ourselves down in small ways and don't |
| 102:11 | really think those promises matter we |
| 102:12 | break commitments to oursel |
| 102:14 | pathologically okay but but you can but |
| 102:16 | you can change that right you can build |
| 102:18 | that up a little bit and we'll see the |
| 102:20 | results in 20 years time bit and healthy |
| 102:23 | and you got a family and kids and you're |
| 102:25 | doing great you're still doing this it's |
| 102:29 | great we'll see it I think you probably |
| 102:32 | you can't beat yourself up over |
| 102:34 | everything right you you have to choose |
| 102:36 | where to suffer you have to choose |
| 102:37 | what's the thing that matters to you and |
| 102:39 | don't just let yourself down on that so |
| 102:41 | maybe you're not going to do everything |
| 102:43 | okay fine do you think that's what |
| 102:46 | confidence is confidence and yeah |
| 102:49 | confidence in yourself is just a |
| 102:52 | combination and a culmination of the |
| 102:53 | commitments you kept to yourself and |
| 102:56 | what you Prov to yourself about yourself |
| 102:58 | I think that's uh I haven't thought |
| 103:00 | about it like that but that seems like a |
| 103:01 | very uh logical |
| 103:03 | conclusion you know it's that thing of |
| 103:05 | you want to give the world irrefutable |
| 103:08 | proof you are who you say you are well |
| 103:10 | the world and yourself there's a mirror |
| 103:12 | up as well are you who you say you are |
| 103:15 | yeah well great that's a that's a lovely |
| 103:18 | thing to be and to build up in small |
| 103:20 | ways I mean that's really you're talking |
| 103:21 | about building character of going well |
| 103:23 | I'm going to make that promise to myself |
| 103:24 | and then I'm going to I'm going to do it |
| 103:26 | so you don't make [ __ ] promises to |
| 103:28 | yourself yeah New Year resolutions are |
| 103:30 | not a good idea because if you're going |
| 103:33 | to let yourself down that's more |
| 103:34 | damaging pick something that you can |
| 103:37 | do pick something |
| 103:40 | small last time we spoke you expressed |
| 103:43 | an aspiration an ambition you had you |
| 103:45 | said I think we were talking about Dave |
| 103:46 | Chappelle and you said you wanted to do |
| 103:48 | longer form |
| 103:49 | jokes yeah so there's there's some stuff |
| 103:52 | in the new show so there's like 20 |
| 103:54 | minutes on being a dad um that I think |
| 103:56 | is really funny and I wanted it to fit |
| 103:59 | within my Persona as well because a lot |
| 104:01 | of people sort of become fathers and |
| 104:03 | they get a bit sentimental and they lose |
| 104:04 | some of their Edge so the stuff that |
| 104:05 | I've got about being a father is uh is |
| 104:08 | brutal but it's funny it's funny it's |
| 104:10 | it's a funny thing to to kind of |
| 104:12 | experience as well it's something kind |
| 104:13 | of new to talk about who's your favorite |
| 104:16 | comic of all time Chris Rock really |
| 104:18 | Chris Rock by yeah Chris Rock I think |
| 104:20 | the uh the the I had the great pleasure |
| 104:23 | of working with Chris as well and he's |
| 104:25 | an extraordinary Talent the uh the the |
| 104:29 | Rhythm and Cadence and the points that |
| 104:32 | he makes and the way that he sets up |
| 104:34 | material um the way that he delivers a |
| 104:36 | bunch line that just everything about it |
| 104:37 | from sort of a technical point of view I |
| 104:39 | admire and I love what he says I I I |
| 104:42 | just think he's he's he's just [ __ ] |
| 104:45 | hilarious and I see the work I see what |
| 104:48 | he does I see the work that he does now |
| 104:50 | he's he's been a legendary Next Level |
| 104:53 | performer for 30 years and he's still |
| 104:57 | working just as |
| 104:58 | hard and you got to love |
| 105:02 | that what did you make of this lap well |
| 105:06 | I mean obviously just I mean it's |
| 105:08 | there's no there's no um there's no |
| 105:12 | argument that's it's a it's a uh I I was |
| 105:18 | I was shocked you know it it strikes me |
| 105:20 | that uh Will Smith may be the greatest |
| 105:23 | actor of his |
| 105:25 | generation because he was pretending to |
| 105:27 | be an entirely different human being for |
| 105:28 | the last 40 |
| 105:30 | years and The Mask |
| 105:33 | slipped and we saw a a Yeah a different |
| 105:38 | side and I think Chris really the |
| 105:40 | extraordinary thing about that moment |
| 105:42 | was Chris Rock got slapped in the |
| 105:44 | face his level of |
| 105:47 | composure |
| 105:49 | was he was like a Hindu cow get slapped |
| 105:52 | in the face by a big dude right |
| 105:55 | hard I just got slapped in the face |
| 105:58 | that's going to be a huge TV moment |
| 106:00 | here's the |
| 106:03 | award he's to be admired incredible |
| 106:08 | man you were on stage as well you know a |
| 106:11 | couple of months after when Dave |
| 106:13 | Chappelle was attacked I actually saw |
| 106:16 | you in the back I remember seeing you |
| 106:17 | sort of come out and just you you kind |
| 106:19 | of looked a little bit like security but |
| 106:20 | maybe not the most yeah me and me well |
| 106:22 | security |
| 106:23 | so when when Dave got rushed uh and it |
| 106:28 | was very scary because you know it could |
| 106:29 | have gone another way um you know the |
| 106:32 | guy had a knife orbe it a knife in a gun |
| 106:36 | it was it was a it was a kind of a fake |
| 106:38 | gun that pressed a button and a knife |
| 106:39 | came out it was a it was a um |
| 106:43 | yes it was it was it was a knife that |
| 106:45 | identified as a gun maybe I don't know |
| 106:47 | anyway so um yeah I remember I was |
| 106:49 | standing with Jeff Ross on the side of |
| 106:50 | the stage and then and then this this |
| 106:52 | thing happened it was yeah it was it's |
| 106:54 | crazy crazy |
| 106:57 | scary had he got his ass beat the person |
| 107:00 | that ran out and got stomped out by like |
| 107:04 | well he got the reason he got stomped |
| 107:05 | out wasn't it wasn't um uh malice it was |
| 107:09 | he wouldn't let go of the gun knife so |
| 107:12 | the guy had a gun what looked like a gun |
| 107:14 | I mean it was a gun and he wouldn't let |
| 107:16 | go of it and they I think um the |
| 107:19 | security guys um uh broke his arm |
| 107:23 | getting the getting the gun off him yeah |
| 107:25 | but what are you going to do let the guy |
| 107:28 | have the gun like it's a it's yeah it's |
| 107:30 | very yeah pretty scary uh scary thing |
| 107:34 | are CH times changing in terms of |
| 107:36 | violence towards comedians is think I |
| 107:39 | think they're they're isolated into uh |
| 107:41 | Eddie Murphy had the best line on it |
| 107:43 | Eddie Murphy said uh he said Will Smith |
| 107:46 | when he slapped Chris Rock rang the |
| 107:48 | dyner bell for |
| 107:50 | crazy all the crazies came out for a |
| 107:52 | couple couple of weeks the guy rushes um |
| 107:56 | Chappelle it's not it's not a great |
| 107:59 | situation I mean it's like it's it's a |
| 108:00 | scary thing when you think you know |
| 108:02 | friends getting rushed by someone with a |
| 108:04 | knife and you sort of think of what |
| 108:06 | could have happened but he was fine and |
| 108:09 | obviously you know was shaken in the |
| 108:11 | moment but he was pretty pretty |
| 108:13 | philosophical about it anyone ever |
| 108:14 | attacked you on stage no I mean |
| 108:17 | threatened you yeah I've been I've been |
| 108:20 | threatened a little bit but okay |
| 108:24 | not part of the game I guess I mean it's |
| 108:27 | like it's that weird thing of like when |
| 108:29 | you there's a there's a routine in it I |
| 108:31 | talk a little bit about uh being |
| 108:32 | canceled on the on the special and you |
| 108:35 | talk about like what I'm going to do |
| 108:37 | next time because it's going to happen |
| 108:39 | again right so the next time I get |
| 108:40 | canceled I've got a plan here's what I'm |
| 108:41 | going to do I'm going to say I've |
| 108:43 | rehearsed this I'm going to make a |
| 108:44 | public statement on the day the news |
| 108:45 | story breaks I'm going to say I'm sorry |
| 108:49 | and the people that are offended will |
| 108:50 | say you don't really mean that apology |
| 108:52 | and I'll say so you're saying I could |
| 108:54 | say something and not mean it now you're |
| 108:56 | getting |
| 108:57 | it a |
| 109:01 | smart but it's that it's they're jokes |
| 109:03 | you can't go around apologizing for |
| 109:05 | jokes I'm exceptionally excited to sit |
| 109:08 | down and watch your Netflix special |
| 109:10 | Natural Born Killer which came out on |
| 109:11 | April 16th there's been a lot of |
| 109:14 | conversation around it because I think a |
| 109:16 | lot of people are acknowledging that |
| 109:17 | you've adopted a slightly different |
| 109:18 | style to the past and everyone's excited |
| 109:20 | to see this this newer Jimmy this |
| 109:23 | this heavily iterated optimized version |
| 109:26 | of Jimmy that's taken 51 years to |
| 109:28 | produce and I always talk to people |
| 109:30 | about our last conversation and you |
| 109:32 | telling me that even you at at the peak |
| 109:34 | of the mountain in many people's eyes |
| 109:36 | are still trying to find small marginal |
| 109:39 | gains and and challenge yourself and |
| 109:41 | come out of your comfort zone and I |
| 109:43 | think that's exactly what you do in this |
| 109:44 | special I've been fortunate enough to |
| 109:46 | see some of the the jokes and the angles |
| 109:48 | in the special and I think for some |
| 109:49 | reason it feels to me like Society needs |
| 109:52 | to have some of these conversations as |
| 109:54 | well so what even though there is humor |
| 109:55 | there underneath the the jokes you tell |
| 109:58 | there's um I think there's an underlying |
| 110:00 | important message that's greeting |
| 110:01 | Society at the right |
| 110:02 | moment I very much appreciate that is |
| 110:05 | that accurate is that an accurate |
| 110:06 | assessment I think it is I think it's it |
| 110:08 | has it is different to the last special |
| 110:11 | and it's got more of me in it and it's |
| 110:13 | like I'm in a very privileged position |
| 110:16 | where people you know some people listen |
| 110:18 | to me uh and I have my audience I know |
| 110:20 | what my audience are so I can I can get |
| 110:23 | a message in under the wire uh that |
| 110:25 | other people can't really talk about and |
| 110:27 | so that thing of going if I'm doing sex |
| 110:29 | ed I do sex ed in my way and it's very |
| 110:32 | funny but it's getting a message across |
| 110:34 | to young men that I think is very |
| 110:37 | valuable I'm excited to listen |
| 110:40 | specifically about the stuff about |
| 110:41 | consent very very excited Jimmy we have |
| 110:43 | a closing tradition on this podcast |
| 110:44 | where the last guest leaves a question |
| 110:45 | for the next guest not knowing who |
| 110:47 | they're going to be leaving it for oh |
| 110:49 | well I've given this literally no |
| 110:50 | thought so right okay I don't get to see |
| 110:53 | it either which is funny people don't |
| 110:55 | believe me when I say that but okay |
| 110:56 | what's the have I got a question you |
| 110:58 | have got a question that's been left for |
| 111:00 | you the question that's been left for |
| 111:01 | you is what would you tell your |
| 111:04 | 20-year-old self that you wish you knew |
| 111:07 | and that would have positively impacted |
| 111:09 | your life and helped you to avoid |
| 111:12 | unnecessary |
| 111:17 | pain I think I would have said enjoy |
| 111:20 | yourself more |
| 111:23 | try and be more present I think I was uh |
| 111:27 | I think I was worried about the results |
| 111:29 | and not the process at that age I think |
| 111:31 | I was worried about what kind of degree |
| 111:32 | I would get uh and working hard and I |
| 111:35 | should have been worried about having |
| 111:37 | more |
| 111:38 | fun what's telling you in hindsight that |
| 111:40 | that's the important thing you needed to |
| 111:42 | hear at that point what was the symptom |
| 111:44 | of not hearing that I think it was I |
| 111:47 | think there's a there's a weird thing in |
| 111:49 | uh if you're in Academia and you have |
| 111:52 | that imposter syndrome and you feel like |
| 111:54 | oh oh God what's what's I don't belong |
| 111:58 | here I'm not bright enough I need to |
| 111:59 | work harder that's valuable in one sense |
| 112:01 | it makes you kind of work harder but |
| 112:03 | actually you know should have what's |
| 112:05 | what what's college for it's just for |
| 112:07 | growing up be in the moment I what do |
| 112:11 | you think of |
| 112:12 | University I think University is a |
| 112:15 | luxury item now I think the intrinsic |
| 112:17 | value of university is less important |
| 112:20 | than the what it signals about you so I |
| 112:24 | think a degree from Cambridge is a Louis |
| 112:27 | Vuitton bag it's a luxury item that says |
| 112:30 | oh I have this um you can just get the |
| 112:33 | reading list and read the books I'm not |
| 112:35 | sure whether whether |
| 112:37 | academia's you know I don't know I've |
| 112:39 | got strong views on Academia because I |
| 112:41 | was when I went to University it was |
| 112:43 | free right it was very difficult to get |
| 112:44 | in but it was free and I think we should |
| 112:47 | bring that back I think if you're doing |
| 112:50 | let's say stem right let's say you're |
| 112:52 | studying any stem subject University |
| 112:53 | should be free in the UK and if you get |
| 112:57 | a stem degree from anywhere else in the |
| 112:59 | world it should come with um British |
| 113:02 | passport |
| 113:04 | attached come spend some time here great |
| 113:07 | it's not a bad |
| 113:09 | policy your kid turns to you one day and |
| 113:12 | says daddy |
| 113:14 | I'm I want to be a |
| 113:18 | magician what' you say to your kid they |
| 113:20 | want to be a a magician or they say that |
| 113:22 | I want to be an NBA player let's do that |
| 113:24 | one what' you say to your kid wait go |
| 113:27 | back become a magician um uh I I don't |
| 113:31 | know I mean listen it's it's uh I |
| 113:34 | suppose it's that thing of like follow |
| 113:35 | your |
| 113:37 | dreams if they're hiring it's Chris |
| 113:40 | rocks line isn't it yeah Follow Your |
| 113:43 | Passion if they're hiring if you if if |
| 113:45 | you're good at that if you're I don't |
| 113:48 | know if my kid winds up being 7 foot I'd |
| 113:50 | be surprised but if he is then maybe |
| 113:52 | maybe then you know maybe there's a |
| 113:54 | maybe there's a future in it but |
| 113:55 | the yeah pick something that seems |
| 113:58 | realistic to you have you got a bias |
| 114:01 | about what you want your son to do uh |
| 114:04 | honestly because we all have I would |
| 114:07 | have a I would have a bit of a bias I I |
| 114:09 | mean I don't know I don't know what jobs |
| 114:11 | are going to be in 30 years time right |
| 114:14 | you you want your kid to be happy and |
| 114:16 | maybe maybe to have some sort of uh |
| 114:20 | grounding in critical thinking and |
| 114:21 | beyond that I know good luck Jimmy thank |
| 114:25 | you our first conversation really blew |
| 114:27 | me away and it it taught me something |
| 114:30 | about actually about this podcast you're |
| 114:33 | one of the real defining conversations I |
| 114:34 | had that taught me that |
| 114:37 | everyone is much more |
| 114:39 | than the surface that you see and it's |
| 114:42 | funny cuz when last time when we |
| 114:44 | recorded it was upstairs in my kitchen |
| 114:45 | my previous kitchen and the team text me |
| 114:47 | when you arrived and they said oh Jimmy |
| 114:49 | car's just arrived I think you arrived |
| 114:50 | on your bicycle or something and they're |
| 114:51 | like oh God he's just a joke about |
| 114:53 | someone's mom downstairs and I thought |
| 114:54 | oh this is this is Jimmy car the Jimmy |
| 114:56 | car I've seen on nine out of 10 cats and |
| 114:58 | then we went upstairs and had that |
| 114:59 | conversation and it just blew my mind it |
| 115:02 | just absolutely blew my mind well this |
| 115:04 | is the difficult second album how did I |
| 115:06 | do oh fantastic oh great fantastic |
| 115:09 | absolutely but no it really it taught me |
| 115:11 | that um people are much more than than |
| 115:13 | just the the mask that we wear and we |
| 115:15 | all wear a mask you know Persona to get |
| 115:17 | through life and we find it easier |
| 115:19 | sometimes to wear the mask than to |
| 115:20 | confront who we actually are but in that |
| 115:22 | ation I feel like I got to meet The Man |
| 115:24 | Behind the Mask per se and I I really |
| 115:27 | like sharing that side of myself I I I |
| 115:29 | really enjoy this I really enjoy the |
| 115:30 | show I wish you every success thank you |
