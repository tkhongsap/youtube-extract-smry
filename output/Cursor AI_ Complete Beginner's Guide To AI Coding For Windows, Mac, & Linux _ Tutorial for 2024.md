| 00:00 | that's a live website link go to that |
| 00:02 | website it exists on the internet you |
| 00:04 | can share with your friends Etc let's |
| 00:06 | try it here is the easiest simplest |
| 00:08 | guide you'll ever get for cursor Ai and |
| 00:10 | I'm going to show you how to use it from |
| 00:12 | start to finish trust me when I say easy |
| 00:15 | I mean easy y'all I'm giving you a free |
| 00:17 | Google doc that's going to walk you |
| 00:19 | through step by step for Mac Windows |
| 00:21 | Linux we're going to do everything |
| 00:23 | together you're going to have this |
| 00:24 | Google doc and on top of that if you |
| 00:27 | have questions like you run into air |
| 00:28 | like Corbin I ran that terminal command |
| 00:30 | I got an error what's even going on |
| 00:31 | don't worry I even solved for that by |
| 00:33 | clicking that little link right there |
| 00:34 | and I'll put in the description down |
| 00:35 | below as well I created an entire chat |
| 00:37 | gbt chat that you can ask very specific |
| 00:40 | questions and get very specific outputs |
| 00:42 | to help you build out your first cursor |
| 00:43 | AI project all the way to the point of |
| 00:45 | having a live website link therefore if |
| 00:47 | you run into errors you have this video |
| 00:49 | with me in it you have an entire Google |
| 00:51 | doc and you have an entire chbt chat |
| 00:53 | sound good let's jump in this video is |
| 00:55 | here because of extreme popular demand |
| 00:58 | I'm going to show you stepbystep as if |
| 01:00 | you've never launched anything to do |
| 01:02 | with code never used anything with code |
| 01:04 | I'm going to show you everything to |
| 01:05 | install how to run it how to apply it |
| 01:07 | everything everything Corbin everything |
| 01:09 | to the point that you'll have a live |
| 01:11 | website link that looks like this with |
| 01:13 | your website and your code deployed that |
| 01:16 | is why I went the extra mile of this |
| 01:17 | video and I gave you a Google doc that's |
| 01:19 | going to show you how to do it step by |
| 01:20 | step and allows for every single OS |
| 01:22 | system to even access it so it's simple |
| 01:25 | by the end of this video we're going to |
| 01:27 | take code like this push it to an actual |
| 01:29 | live website link not Local Host 3000 |
| 01:31 | although I'll show that as well but an |
| 01:32 | actual live website link you can start |
| 01:34 | using right away so grab your coffee and |
| 01:37 | let's get going I have no clue how long |
| 01:39 | this video is going to be I assume 20 to |
| 01:41 | 40 minutes long but we'll see let's jump |
| 01:43 | in first step of all first steps |
| 01:45 | download cursor AI it's free to start |
| 01:48 | proceed simply click download for free |
| 01:50 | once you've downloaded cursor AI let's |
| 01:52 | do step one enter Google doc here which |
| 01:54 | is going to be creating a project |
| 01:55 | directory when looking at this Google |
| 01:57 | doc I structured it as simple as |
| 01:59 | possible I mean I could not have |
| 02:00 | structured this any simpler y'all what I |
| 02:02 | do is I provide the commands relevant to |
| 02:04 | your operating system and then on top of |
| 02:06 | that I make sure to apply a additional |
| 02:08 | note here the purpose of the additional |
| 02:09 | note here is to explain as Layman as |
| 02:11 | possible what's even happening in the |
| 02:13 | process so let's go and start here to |
| 02:15 | start off all we need to do is come down |
| 02:17 | to this button right here click it and |
| 02:18 | go to terminal now that we got terminal |
| 02:20 | open let's do that first command coming |
| 02:22 | over to Google doc here here is our |
| 02:24 | first terminal command think of terminal |
| 02:25 | as our way of conversating within our |
| 02:27 | computer don't worry about it don't |
| 02:28 | complicate it this is our receed I'm |
| 02:30 | going to go ahead and copy this and |
| 02:32 | before you rush to the comments yes I |
| 02:33 | got the commands for Windows as well so |
| 02:35 | everyone's going to be able to follow |
| 02:36 | this tutorial and as I said before if |
| 02:38 | any terminology doesn't make sense use |
| 02:41 | that Chad gbt chat or alternatively read |
| 02:44 | the additional note for you to |
| 02:45 | understand what is terminal what is a |
| 02:47 | repository what are we even doing right |
| 02:48 | now you can simply ask Chad GPT here or |
| 02:51 | read the additional notes trust me y'all |
| 02:53 | I got a lot of comments said this was |
| 02:55 | not simple enough I'm trying to make it |
| 02:56 | as simple as possible so goinging back |
| 02:57 | to a terminal here I'm going to command |
| 02:59 | V it's going to paste it and this is |
| 03:00 | what we're going to call a directory I |
| 03:02 | want you to think of your directory like |
| 03:03 | where we're going to store an entire |
| 03:05 | codebase codebase what I mean in this |
| 03:06 | context is that code that we deploy to a |
| 03:09 | website like when I go to a website |
| 03:11 | that's deployed code when I say deploy I |
| 03:13 | mean you have it locally on your laptop |
| 03:16 | like let's just say you have like a text |
| 03:17 | file right you drag and drop it it's in |
| 03:19 | the trash only you have access it's not |
| 03:20 | like a shared Google doc it's just like |
| 03:22 | a local text file but now we're |
| 03:25 | deploying it to the internet if some of |
| 03:26 | you are like Corin why did you even |
| 03:27 | explain it like that I'm trying to |
| 03:28 | explain this as simple as possible all |
| 03:29 | right right so I'm going to go ahead and |
| 03:30 | name it first project this could be |
| 03:32 | anything apples and ham green eggs and |
| 03:35 | ham time to code new Facebook anything |
| 03:38 | y'all this is just your name this is how |
| 03:39 | you're going to reference it I mean I |
| 03:40 | named it corn beef hash up there so this |
| 03:41 | could be really anything I'm going hit |
| 03:43 | enter now that we've done that we're |
| 03:45 | going to do the next command here which |
| 03:46 | is going to allow us to access this |
| 03:48 | directory within the terminal itself so |
| 03:50 | I do CD and then the actual name of the |
| 03:53 | project so I'm going to pick here slash |
| 03:56 | here we go and what you'll notice is |
| 03:57 | that this little terminal line here is |
| 04:00 | going to extend it means we're |
| 04:02 | conversating it within that we're |
| 04:03 | talking directly within that folder for |
| 04:05 | all the code and everything we're about |
| 04:07 | to install when it comes to doing stuff |
| 04:09 | in a software development environment |
| 04:11 | now Pro tip number one create yourself a |
| 04:13 | terminal cheat sheet in your notes |
| 04:15 | stickies whatever it may be these are |
| 04:17 | going to be commands that you run |
| 04:18 | repetitively throughout the application |
| 04:20 | development process so for example this |
| 04:22 | right here is very important let me show |
| 04:24 | you why when I start a new terminal and |
| 04:27 | you don't see like first project or |
| 04:28 | whatever you name it all you need to do |
| 04:30 | is simply paste that command and you're |
| 04:33 | going to go and you'll basically be |
| 04:34 | running every single command you see |
| 04:36 | from here on out in this tutorial |
| 04:38 | through this sound good we've |
| 04:40 | successfully created a repository it's |
| 04:42 | going to allow us to create code files |
| 04:44 | and do everything like that now I'm |
| 04:45 | going to go ahead and hit open folder in |
| 04:47 | open folder here I'm going to Simply |
| 04:48 | select the folder that's relevant to the |
| 04:50 | project I just created so first project |
| 04:52 | is the name here I'm going hit open now |
| 04:54 | that I've opened my folder here we are |
| 04:56 | in cursor Ai and we've successfully |
| 04:58 | created an area where we can install |
| 05:00 | dependencies react like everything we |
| 05:02 | would want to build out a web |
| 05:03 | development application Step One is done |
| 05:06 | let's go to step two here which is going |
| 05:07 | to allow us to install node.js this is |
| 05:08 | how we're going to build our react |
| 05:10 | application here and we got the |
| 05:11 | step-by-step guide right here as |
| 05:13 | referenced before we got Mac Linux and |
| 05:14 | windows so don't worry let's begin here |
| 05:17 | as a Mac User so I'm going to go and |
| 05:18 | copy this first line don't worry I got |
| 05:20 | the windows version as well now when |
| 05:21 | installing node.js and home brew and |
| 05:23 | everything you're about to see right now |
| 05:24 | we're going to create a new terminal |
| 05:25 | window if you want to know how to access |
| 05:27 | this on Mac simply type in terminal you |
| 05:28 | want to know how to access on Windows |
| 05:30 | and Linux simply type in terminal same |
| 05:32 | deal here there's going to be a global |
| 05:33 | directory this is going to be our |
| 05:34 | overall laptop so we're no longer inside |
| 05:37 | of first project because what we're |
| 05:39 | installing here is going to be used |
| 05:40 | throughout our laptop in the context of |
| 05:42 | software development sound good paste |
| 05:44 | that first link once you paste the first |
| 05:46 | link hit enter now because of the fact |
| 05:47 | that this is going to be used throughout |
| 05:48 | your laptop in the context of |
| 05:50 | development this is going to be require |
| 05:52 | pseudo access pseudo access in this |
| 05:53 | context means administrative access or |
| 05:55 | basically do you own your computer like |
| 05:57 | is this yours and your password once I |
| 05:59 | do this and also as a side note when you |
| 06:01 | enter passwords like it doesn't show you |
| 06:03 | like a little asteris like it's there |
| 06:05 | right now but obviously you don't see it |
| 06:07 | hit enter this is just going to go over |
| 06:09 | everything that's installing here we |
| 06:10 | don't have to worry go ahead and hit |
| 06:12 | enter we are installing home brew home |
| 06:14 | home home brew home brew we got it |
| 06:17 | installed and what I usually like doing |
| 06:18 | after a big command like this is you can |
| 06:20 | just Spam enter and we're out of the |
| 06:22 | next second thing we need to install |
| 06:24 | here is going to be nodejs so we're |
| 06:26 | going to do Brew install node now look |
| 06:28 | at this I got an air here it says Brew |
| 06:30 | doesn't exist but we just installed Brew |
| 06:32 | what is going on here obviously you get |
| 06:34 | air like this go ahead and copy |
| 06:35 | everything paste it into this chat get |
| 06:37 | help but I found the solution and I went |
| 06:39 | ahead and just added it to the dock here |
| 06:40 | so for example in this context we need |
| 06:42 | to make sure to add home RW to the path |
| 06:43 | like so we can actually reference it |
| 06:45 | within our terminal here copy this |
| 06:46 | entire thing here you're going to put |
| 06:48 | your name there though so for example my |
| 06:50 | current profile on Mac is called coffee |
| 06:52 | fuel so my specific line is going to |
| 06:54 | have coffee fuel for the users therefore |
| 06:57 | if you run into this air for Linux or |
| 06:58 | Windows make sure to use that CH gbt |
| 07:00 | chat just copy the entire terminal |
| 07:02 | output and it'll help you out from here |
| 07:04 | we can go and continue to our next step |
| 07:05 | here we're going to do Brew install node |
| 07:07 | and here we go so while that installs I |
| 07:09 | want to make clear again that if I run |
| 07:11 | into any errors in this video we'll walk |
| 07:12 | you through step byep how to solve it |
| 07:14 | I'll add it to the doc but that's the |
| 07:15 | idea here I want to make this as simple |
| 07:17 | as possible like I can't make this any |
| 07:18 | more simple so try my best here but in |
| 07:22 | any context I run into an error proceed |
| 07:24 | in this manner use the resources and go |
| 07:27 | it's been successfully installed onto |
| 07:29 | the next Next Step so now that we have |
| 07:31 | successfully installed node.js this |
| 07:33 | command will work I know this is from a |
| 07:34 | past video a lot of y'all in the |
| 07:36 | comments are like Corbin it didn't even |
| 07:37 | work like npx it didn't even work it's |
| 07:39 | going to work now copy this line come |
| 07:41 | back to cursor AI here come back to your |
| 07:43 | terminal which is in our directory this |
| 07:45 | is very important it's in our directory |
| 07:47 | and every time I reference directory I'm |
| 07:48 | referring to the project name first |
| 07:50 | project paste that line that's the wrong |
| 07:52 | line we actually copy the right one |
| 07:54 | there we go and hit enter this is going |
| 07:57 | to install react files that are relevant |
| 07:59 | for application development that rammed |
| 08:01 | on accident let it install let it |
| 08:04 | install install inall boom boom and boom |
| 08:08 | once it's installed that's where all |
| 08:10 | these files come into play that we can |
| 08:11 | start playing around with so you'll see |
| 08:13 | this here and if you got to this point |
| 08:14 | then you have successfully completed |
| 08:16 | step two here you have created a new |
| 08:18 | react project with me if anything I just |
| 08:20 | said in the last couple minutes didn't |
| 08:21 | make sense read the additional note as |
| 08:23 | Chad jbt let's proceed to step three |
| 08:25 | here which is connecting GitHub now let |
| 08:27 | me explain GitHub a little bit to anyone |
| 08:29 | that doesn't have any idea what this is |
| 08:30 | it's two major things well first major |
| 08:32 | thing it's free so proceed completely |
| 08:35 | free to use for everything you about to |
| 08:36 | se in this video the second major thing |
| 08:38 | about GitHub here is that it allows for |
| 08:40 | you to back up your code in the cloud |
| 08:42 | when I say cloud I mean like the |
| 08:43 | internet right so all your code isn't |
| 08:45 | just on your laptop your laptop Burns |
| 08:47 | you lost your code oh no cups it's done |
| 08:50 | having GitHub though will have it stored |
| 08:52 | in the cloud this allows us to create |
| 08:54 | you know versions of our apps right |
| 08:56 | version one version two if you really |
| 08:58 | mess up on version two and you want to |
| 08:59 | roll back to version one using GitHub we |
| 09:02 | can roll back to a previous commit this |
| 09:04 | allows us to have more flexibility when |
| 09:06 | coding create different branches when I |
| 09:08 | say branches different offshoots of the |
| 09:11 | same application maybe a new feature oh |
| 09:12 | I'm adding a footer for this branch and |
| 09:14 | if I mess up entirely bad I can just |
| 09:16 | revert back to an older Branch think of |
| 09:18 | a branch like a version I'm trying my |
| 09:20 | best here y'all trying to explain this |
| 09:21 | as simple as possible this will make |
| 09:22 | more sense when you actually start using |
| 09:24 | GitHub in application process as it's |
| 09:27 | you know obviously kind of hard for me |
| 09:28 | to explain through ation everything |
| 09:30 | above the board here let's go and |
| 09:31 | proceed here create your GitHub account |
| 09:34 | here we go we're going to create our |
| 09:35 | first GitHub repo together exciting |
| 09:38 | stuff if you feel like you learn |
| 09:38 | something up to this point make sure you |
| 09:39 | leave a like is completely free let's |
| 09:41 | begin here we're going to hit new when |
| 09:43 | we are in these settings here we're |
| 09:45 | going to make sure we fill out a very |
| 09:46 | specific type of wording here the first |
| 09:49 | thing here is your repository name what |
| 09:50 | I typically like doing is naming the |
| 09:52 | repository name in GitHub the same name |
| 09:54 | I used it in my local project when I say |
| 09:56 | local project I'm referring to this |
| 09:58 | what's actually physically on my |
| 09:59 | computer so for me I'm just going to |
| 10:01 | call this GitHub repository first |
| 10:03 | project as well first project |
| 10:05 | description optional and then finally |
| 10:07 | which is probably the most important |
| 10:08 | part here is that you have the choice be |
| 10:09 | doing public and private most likely I |
| 10:11 | would assume most of you want private so |
| 10:13 | people can just steal your code so |
| 10:15 | choose private these other options we |
| 10:17 | can just leave unselected and hit create |
| 10:19 | repository now once you create your |
| 10:20 | repository here it's going to give you a |
| 10:22 | ton of directions and stuff to do don't |
| 10:24 | worry we're going to do that together in |
| 10:25 | this video and of course it's all |
| 10:27 | outlined in step three so before before |
| 10:29 | anything though let's go ahead and |
| 10:31 | initialize git on our computer so we can |
| 10:33 | do git commands and everything works in |
| 10:35 | that manner when I say git git I'm |
| 10:38 | referencing our ability to conversate |
| 10:41 | with GitHub here in our terminal so |
| 10:43 | coming back to my Global terminal here |
| 10:45 | I'll just call Global it's Global I'm |
| 10:46 | going to go ahead and paste this command |
| 10:48 | Brew install git enter this is going to |
| 10:51 | make it so that any git command you're |
| 10:52 | going to be able to do in your laptop |
| 10:53 | and have no issue with that successfully |
| 10:55 | installed let's do step one here where |
| 10:57 | basically our goal is we connecting the |
| 11:00 | cloud with her local project here we're |
| 11:02 | going to connect the to so with this |
| 11:04 | command line here make sure to replace # |
| 11:06 | youro with your repo name so for me it's |
| 11:10 | first project for you it's fill in the |
| 11:12 | blank coming back to my terminal here |
| 11:13 | and I'll jump over here so I'm not |
| 11:15 | blocking it I'm going to go ahead and |
| 11:16 | paste those lines notice Echo hasht |
| 11:19 | first project name or first project |
| 11:21 | everything else is the exact same we're |
| 11:23 | going to do a first commit together hit |
| 11:24 | enter pretty good as you'll see we got |
| 11:26 | one file changed and we got a new read |
| 11:28 | me welcome to the readme so now that we |
| 11:30 | know the kind of connection of adding a |
| 11:32 | readme file let's connect our repository |
| 11:34 | here so I'm going to copy this what I |
| 11:36 | want you to notice is this your username |
| 11:38 | is going to be found up here so if you |
| 11:40 | scroll up here you're going to go all |
| 11:42 | the way to your top left my username is |
| 11:44 | Coffey fuel bump my project name my repo |
| 11:47 | is first project it's very important you |
| 11:49 | put your username and your project for |
| 11:52 | this terminal command you're going to |
| 11:53 | replace your username with your username |
| 11:56 | your repo with your repo minus first |
| 11:59 | project same situation here the last |
| 12:01 | thing we need to add to this terminal |
| 12:03 | command though is going to be your |
| 12:04 | personal access token this gives us the |
| 12:06 | ability to access this git because of |
| 12:09 | the fact that it's private we need to |
| 12:11 | add this step here to add it's pretty |
| 12:13 | simple we're going to come over here to |
| 12:14 | the top right here and we're going to |
| 12:15 | Simply hit settings once we're in our |
| 12:17 | settings here we're going to scroll down |
| 12:19 | and we're going to go to developer |
| 12:20 | settings we're going to find personal |
| 12:22 | access token here find grain tokens once |
| 12:24 | we're here we're going to say generate |
| 12:26 | new token just to take a step back here |
| 12:28 | cuz you're like cor what we you even |
| 12:29 | doing right now like what's even |
| 12:30 | happening what do you mean a token |
| 12:32 | talking about like crypto no no no no |
| 12:34 | token in this context then give it like |
| 12:36 | a key to a lock this is going to give us |
| 12:38 | the ability to access this repository |
| 12:40 | through a local machine because we got |
| 12:42 | the key like DJ khed said I got the keys |
| 12:45 | another one another one okay name your |
| 12:48 | token so this can be anything I say |
| 12:50 | first project I'm just going to do first |
| 12:51 | project token here expiration date we'll |
| 12:53 | say 90 days actually we'll do seven days |
| 12:56 | CU this is like temporary for me you can |
| 12:58 | add a descript for what the tokens |
| 13:00 | context is so whatever your app is that |
| 13:01 | you're developing here and the next part |
| 13:03 | is very important here so we're going to |
| 13:04 | say only select repositories we're going |
| 13:06 | to select our very specific repository |
| 13:08 | which for me is first project so that's |
| 13:10 | going to be right there first project |
| 13:12 | next with these permissions we are |
| 13:14 | basically going to give this token |
| 13:15 | access to everything everything coron |
| 13:17 | everything so what you want to do is |
| 13:20 | you're going to go through every single |
| 13:21 | one of these steps here and you're |
| 13:23 | simply going to put read and write read |
| 13:25 | and write like whatever the max is |
| 13:27 | you're going to give it so let me go and |
| 13:28 | do that real quick to this first step |
| 13:30 | every single one of those options is |
| 13:32 | read and right let's go to the next one |
| 13:34 | account permissions here same deal |
| 13:36 | thinking admin access here we want to |
| 13:37 | give this token all the possibilities so |
| 13:40 | that we never run into errors read and |
| 13:42 | write for everything just to confirm |
| 13:44 | with y'all there we go and for the ones |
| 13:45 | you're like Corin what about that one |
| 13:47 | that says read only that's just because |
| 13:48 | that is the max that's afforded to me in |
| 13:50 | that once that's done we're going to |
| 13:52 | Simply hit generate token here now this |
| 13:54 | is going to look blank to you why |
| 13:55 | because that's the aess token but make |
| 13:58 | sure with this token you copy that save |
| 14:00 | that somewhere safe as you'll never be |
| 14:01 | able to see it again now obviously if |
| 14:03 | you mess up lost it need to redo these |
| 14:05 | steps just generate a new token and |
| 14:07 | follow what I just showed you all right |
| 14:09 | coming back here what I suggest you to |
| 14:10 | do is I suggest you to copy all of this |
| 14:13 | put it into a notes and simply like just |
| 14:16 | replace these variables with your |
| 14:18 | specific variables so that you can go |
| 14:20 | ahead and just paste it in one block and |
| 14:22 | hit enter I'm going to go and do that |
| 14:24 | just for your reference this is what it |
| 14:25 | looks like obviously I input all my |
| 14:27 | relevant variables the only I didn't |
| 14:29 | input was my personal access token to do |
| 14:32 | so simply grab this and just paste over |
| 14:35 | with your access token we going to do |
| 14:36 | this all in one go here just for |
| 14:38 | reference that's what it should look |
| 14:40 | like obviously add your personal access |
| 14:42 | token that we just got right there I'm |
| 14:43 | going hit enter a couple times I'm going |
| 14:44 | to paste that block and then hit enter |
| 14:47 | once I do that this is what a successful |
| 14:49 | message looks like and I should be able |
| 14:50 | to go back to my GitHub here and see it |
| 14:52 | we successfully connected cursor AI with |
| 14:55 | GitHub it's private no one else will be |
| 14:57 | able to access it only you can with that |
| 14:59 | personal access token as I said before |
| 15:01 | you run into any errors any issues any |
| 15:03 | questions of course leave it in the |
| 15:04 | comments down below I'm assuming someone |
| 15:06 | within the community can help but also |
| 15:08 | you got to chat gbt chat here I want to |
| 15:10 | be very clear here though what I'm |
| 15:11 | showing you in this video is very |
| 15:12 | complex work but I'm trying to make it |
| 15:14 | as simple as possible so if you run into |
| 15:15 | issues and errors and this is your first |
| 15:16 | time ever coding that's to be expected |
| 15:18 | that's just kind of how every beginner's |
| 15:20 | Journey starts right so don't give up |
| 15:22 | keep going at it this is very advanced |
| 15:23 | stuff that I'm trying to make like |
| 15:25 | bite-sized chicken nuggets which you |
| 15:28 | know is really good spicy barbecue sauce |
| 15:30 | sweet and sour sometimes it can hit it |
| 15:33 | can hit but keep that in mind okay let |
| 15:36 | me just show you how to do your first |
| 15:37 | commit here so you can understand what a |
| 15:39 | commit is you've heard this term before |
| 15:40 | you're like why do these why do these |
| 15:41 | people keep talking about commit are you |
| 15:42 | trying to commit a relationship or no no |
| 15:44 | no like actual commit in the context of |
| 15:46 | coding so let's go ahead and learn how |
| 15:47 | we do this when can a commit occur a |
| 15:49 | commit can occur when your local code |
| 15:52 | what's found here is not found in the |
| 15:54 | cloud when I say the cloud I'm talking |
| 15:55 | about GitHub to know what branch you're |
| 15:57 | in or what version you're playing with |
| 15:59 | you're going to look over here see how |
| 16:00 | it says Main in order to know what |
| 16:02 | branches happening here when I say |
| 16:04 | Branch I'm just talking about like this |
| 16:05 | is like a snapshot of what your code |
| 16:07 | looks like in this specific version I |
| 16:10 | guess a simpler way of putting that is |
| 16:11 | like you got Google doc a that says like |
| 16:14 | hello great day you got Google dob that |
| 16:17 | says hello great day to you the slight |
| 16:20 | Chang is the to you so that' be Google |
| 16:22 | dob would be like a separate Branch |
| 16:23 | Google doca would just be the original |
| 16:26 | wording let me know if this makes sense |
| 16:28 | I'm trying to explain expl this as |
| 16:29 | simple as possible the idea here is this |
| 16:31 | we got our main and you know to see what |
| 16:33 | branch we're say get Branch right now |
| 16:35 | we're in main so now that we know that |
| 16:36 | we're in main it's like the main branch |
| 16:38 | here that we can revert back to let me |
| 16:40 | show you a commit so right now this is |
| 16:41 | the read me file me zoom out a little |
| 16:44 | bit has all this stuff in here I don't |
| 16:46 | care I don't care command a delete first |
| 16:48 | thing you're going to notice is that |
| 16:49 | notice how the branch has a little |
| 16:51 | asteris next to it that means that |
| 16:52 | something's changed like there's a |
| 16:54 | difference between the one in the cloud |
| 16:55 | and the one in your local machine second |
| 16:57 | thing you'll notice is that noce how |
| 16:59 | read me is now blue that means that a |
| 17:00 | change had incurred therefore what is |
| 17:02 | this change let's just say hello leave a |
| 17:05 | like if you enjoyed the video that's our |
| 17:08 | change command save now in order for us |
| 17:10 | to push this to GitHub and have it |
| 17:12 | reflected in the cloud because right now |
| 17:14 | this is not reflected if I go to the |
| 17:15 | read me it's the same stuff we just had |
| 17:18 | before don't want that we'll do the |
| 17:20 | following commands and I encourage you |
| 17:21 | to add this to the cheat sheet you're |
| 17:23 | creating as this is how you always push |
| 17:25 | a new update we're going to do get ad |
| 17:27 | period get commit DM parenthesis or |
| 17:32 | quotation marks give a name for it what |
| 17:35 | what happened what are we pushing here |
| 17:36 | what are we saving here now reality wise |
| 17:38 | if you Cod it for a while sometimes this |
| 17:40 | is kind of crazy stuff like you just put |
| 17:41 | something random just because you're |
| 17:42 | like I just need to push this but good |
| 17:45 | etiquette I suppose is to name the |
| 17:48 | commit what happened what changed so for |
| 17:50 | this one read me changed we're going to |
| 17:54 | do quotation again hit enter and the |
| 17:56 | final thing we have to do is get push |
| 17:59 | origin and then the branch name so since |
| 18:02 | we're in main that's the branch name I |
| 18:05 | hit main here and doom it's go to go |
| 18:08 | coming back over to a GitHub here I'm |
| 18:09 | going to reload and what you'll notice |
| 18:11 | is that it'll be three commits now |
| 18:14 | within that commit you can see the |
| 18:15 | actual commit name I can click that and |
| 18:17 | within the commit name once you click it |
| 18:20 | it shows you what's changed so in this |
| 18:22 | context we deleted all this code bye-bye |
| 18:25 | is red and we added that one little line |
| 18:27 | hello leave a like if you enjoyed sound |
| 18:30 | good now if you followed along you have |
| 18:31 | successfully done your first commit to |
| 18:32 | GitHub you are a full-on software |
| 18:34 | engineer now full stack developer let's |
| 18:36 | move on on to step four here which is |
| 18:39 | going to show us how to start the react |
| 18:41 | application which really just takes a |
| 18:43 | simple command of npm start what this is |
| 18:45 | going to do is this is going to open up |
| 18:46 | a separate web browser and it's going to |
| 18:48 | be a local host 3000 EUR simply put in |
| 18:50 | the command hit enter once you hit enter |
| 18:52 | it's going to open up a browser here and |
| 18:54 | this is what you're going to see what's |
| 18:55 | being reflected here is the code found |
| 18:58 | in app. yes this is what's being |
| 19:00 | reflected here the advantages of being a |
| 19:02 | local host 3000 is two major things |
| 19:04 | first off this is not on the internet |
| 19:06 | like this isn't real this is completely |
| 19:08 | on your computer so if you got a really |
| 19:10 | cool project a really cool app and |
| 19:12 | you're trying to share it to your friend |
| 19:13 | and you send them the link Local Host |
| 19:15 | 3000 not going to show up nothing second |
| 19:17 | thing because that this is all local any |
| 19:21 | change I make is going to reflect |
| 19:22 | instantly so for example edit source |
| 19:25 | app.js and save and reload coming over |
| 19:27 | here I could just be like nah I'm going |
| 19:30 | to do my own thing if you know the |
| 19:31 | reference let me know in the comments if |
| 19:32 | you know that reference command save and |
| 19:35 | right there nah I'm going to do my own |
| 19:37 | thing shows instantly okay that's step |
| 19:39 | four step four is out of the way we're |
| 19:41 | good to go let's go to step five if you |
| 19:43 | gotten up to this point congrats because |
| 19:45 | I can already tell this video is going |
| 19:46 | to be long like really long so this |
| 19:48 | point now is that you successfully from |
| 19:50 | start to finish up to this point of the |
| 19:52 | video have created a react based |
| 19:54 | application now the name of the game is |
| 19:57 | how do we take this application |
| 19:59 | and have it actually show on the |
| 20:01 | internet EG I create something super |
| 20:03 | cool I can actually take that URL and |
| 20:06 | share with my friend let me show you how |
| 20:08 | so to do this we're going to use |
| 20:09 | Firebase and to be honest with you I |
| 20:10 | could dive way deep in why we're using |
| 20:12 | Firebase and just think of firebases our |
| 20:14 | ability to host our website EG if you've |
| 20:17 | done web development in the past like |
| 20:18 | you were hosting with Shopify were you |
| 20:20 | hosting with Google were you hosting |
| 20:21 | with square dance or Square Pants |
| 20:24 | whatever that one is you know what I'm |
| 20:25 | talking about if you want a video of me |
| 20:27 | diving deeper into this topic check that |
| 20:29 | right there I'll show you why basically |
| 20:30 | it costs nothing to run this website |
| 20:32 | this video is so long I'm losing my |
| 20:33 | voice so before we actually do that |
| 20:35 | first command there let's go ahead and |
| 20:37 | create a Firebase project coming over to |
| 20:39 | your projects just type in firebase.com |
| 20:40 | hit create project so with the project |
| 20:43 | name I encourage you to name this |
| 20:44 | something that you can recognize and |
| 20:46 | connect the two dots so for me I'm just |
| 20:48 | going to call it first project again you |
| 20:49 | call it whatever |
| 20:51 | first project let's simply hit continue |
| 20:54 | now if you're watching this tutorial for |
| 20:55 | the purpose of really trying to build |
| 20:57 | out a software or website that you're |
| 20:59 | going to launch obviously enable Google |
| 21:01 | analytics this for me I'm just showing |
| 21:04 | you how to do it so I'm just hit create |
| 21:05 | project we are creating our project in |
| 21:07 | Firebase that's going to allow us to |
| 21:08 | host for free for free for free for free |
| 21:12 | what do you think of that now when using |
| 21:14 | Firebase you have a ton of different |
| 21:16 | options we're creating a web app today |
| 21:19 | hit web with the web app I'm going to |
| 21:20 | give you the exact same name here for |
| 21:22 | project and it's already giving us the |
| 21:23 | option here so we're going to make sure |
| 21:24 | we do Firebase hosting as well that |
| 21:27 | looks good Register App next we're going |
| 21:29 | to do the steps found in our Google doc |
| 21:30 | this is going to be blurred out a little |
| 21:31 | for obvious reasons because that's my |
| 21:33 | stuff I'm going to go ahead and first |
| 21:35 | install Firebase come in over to our |
| 21:37 | Google doc it's mpm install Firebase |
| 21:39 | simply go to your terminal here and |
| 21:40 | we're going to Simply put in mpm install |
| 21:42 | Firebase hit enter with that installed |
| 21:45 | what you'll notice is that our package |
| 21:46 | lock Json and our package Json is going |
| 21:48 | to have a new dependency that's going to |
| 21:50 | be Firebase with the version that's |
| 21:52 | relevant to it let's go to our next step |
| 21:53 | here which is going to put in the |
| 21:54 | relevant code that we need to put in in |
| 21:56 | order to connect Firebase hosting to our |
| 21:59 | project to do so simply put in the |
| 22:00 | command touch source firebase.com |
| 22:06 | with that JS file this is where we're |
| 22:08 | going to put all that relevant code you |
| 22:10 | just saw from firebeast console what |
| 22:12 | code am I talking about this code |
| 22:14 | scrolling down here what you'll notice |
| 22:15 | is that I put it in here as well so use |
| 22:18 | this code right here input all your |
| 22:19 | relevant information and get going here |
| 22:21 | so let me make my life easy here I'm |
| 22:23 | going simply copy all this I'm want to |
| 22:24 | paste it here and then what you should |
| 22:26 | do is simply over paste this or take the |
| 22:28 | code you just saw from Firebase console |
| 22:30 | and paste over here I'm going to hit |
| 22:31 | command save here and obviously it's |
| 22:33 | going to be blurred out a little bit |
| 22:34 | because that's security reasons now that |
| 22:37 | we made that file it's installed let's |
| 22:39 | go ahead and install Firebase tools this |
| 22:41 | is going to allow us to initialize or |
| 22:43 | start hosting for this web app copy this |
| 22:46 | line and before we do that let's go and |
| 22:47 | make a commit here good practice right |
| 22:50 | so you can hit down or up on your arrow |
| 22:51 | keys on your laptop is going to allow |
| 22:53 | you to go to previous commands so for me |
| 22:55 | I can go all the way up here go to get |
| 22:57 | add get commit |
| 22:59 | you know change this maybe let's do uh |
| 23:02 | Firebase added hit enter and then get |
| 23:05 | push origin Main and this is going to |
| 23:07 | add this information to our G Branch |
| 23:10 | this is good practice here so we can |
| 23:11 | revert if we ever mess up now that we've |
| 23:13 | created our fire base.js we've installed |
| 23:16 | the firebeast dependency let's install |
| 23:18 | some tools here it's going to allow us |
| 23:19 | to initialize hosting I'm going to |
| 23:20 | command V the command line we saw |
| 23:22 | earlier here which is this hit enter |
| 23:24 | don't worry y'all we're almost done here |
| 23:26 | I know this is a long stretch but you |
| 23:27 | are learning a ton and I plan on doing |
| 23:29 | more videos to give you more ideas and |
| 23:31 | stuff we can do here but don't worry |
| 23:32 | we're almost done coming back to your |
| 23:34 | Google doc here we're going to do |
| 23:35 | Firebase login this is going to allow us |
| 23:36 | to log into the Google profile that we |
| 23:39 | created with our Firebase account if you |
| 23:41 | want to see these directions again just |
| 23:42 | simply come back to that Firebase page |
| 23:44 | here and you'll notice him here as well |
| 23:45 | Firebase login this is going to pop up a |
| 23:48 | little popup here and you're going to |
| 23:49 | Simply sign in so I'm already signed in |
| 23:51 | here but just to really show you how to |
| 23:52 | do this I'm GNA do Firebase log out so |
| 23:53 | this how you log out and what I suggest |
| 23:55 | you to do this is very important so if |
| 23:56 | you're on this far write this down |
| 23:59 | anytime you want to develop for the day |
| 24:00 | and get going for the day start with |
| 24:02 | Firebase log out Firebase login just |
| 24:05 | refresh it why trust me Firebase login |
| 24:09 | enter you're going to get this prompt |
| 24:10 | here simply hit why this is going to |
| 24:13 | open a choose your account window choose |
| 24:15 | the account you made the Firebase app |
| 24:17 | with if you don't know simply just go |
| 24:19 | back here let me hit like continue to |
| 24:21 | console and then just like see your |
| 24:22 | little selector here that's the one you |
| 24:24 | made it with once you select your |
| 24:25 | account hit continue all of this makes |
| 24:28 | should to hit allow and you should get |
| 24:29 | prompted with this message and you |
| 24:31 | should see the email that you created |
| 24:33 | the Firebase with saying successfully |
| 24:34 | logged in now if it logged in let's go |
| 24:37 | ahead and initialize hosting is going to |
| 24:39 | allow us to have our website live that I |
| 24:41 | can share Firebase in it Firebase in it |
| 24:44 | mate you like shrimp on the barie mate |
| 24:47 | keep it nice get some ribs some brisket |
| 24:50 | maybe some corn on the barie all that's |
| 24:53 | my little Australian accent all right |
| 24:54 | hit enter you're going to get a couple |
| 24:55 | options here now we can dive a ton into |
| 24:58 | this kind of stuff so let me know in the |
| 24:59 | comments if you want to see more stuff |
| 25:00 | of this nature for now though we are |
| 25:01 | just going to do a little select here |
| 25:03 | for a keypad and hit hosting I'm going |
| 25:05 | to do configure files from Firebase |
| 25:07 | hosting enter my bad space space with |
| 25:11 | that selected enter now you're going to |
| 25:13 | get the option of basically creating a |
| 25:15 | project useing an existing project well |
| 25:16 | since we already did all that all the |
| 25:18 | heavy lifting is done use an existing |
| 25:20 | project this is going to then prompt all |
| 25:22 | the relevant projects that we've created |
| 25:23 | together now what you'll notice is like |
| 25:25 | Corin why does it say 4 f52 F that's |
| 25:28 | just be because like the actual first |
| 25:30 | project in Firebase is obviously already |
| 25:31 | taken so sometimes what Firebase will do |
| 25:33 | is just like add a little bit of like a |
| 25:35 | string so you can still get access to it |
| 25:37 | hit enter what do you want to use as |
| 25:39 | your public directory public that's |
| 25:41 | right up here we're going to hit enter |
| 25:42 | configure as a single app page say yes y |
| 25:46 | enter for now we're just going to say no |
| 25:48 | to the automatic builds to GitHub n and |
| 25:50 | then when it prompts us to overwrite the |
| 25:52 | existing index.html hit no n so far so |
| 25:55 | good with all that done what you'll |
| 25:57 | notice is that we are get some nice |
| 25:59 | little Json files and Firebase files and |
| 26:01 | everything we need to do to deploy this |
| 26:03 | let's deploy coming over here to |
| 26:04 | Firebase let's go ahead and just add |
| 26:06 | hosting to a shortcut so we can see this |
| 26:09 | two major steps here first one is npm |
| 26:11 | run build what this does is this builds |
| 26:14 | out our front end everything you see |
| 26:16 | visually this is the react application |
| 26:18 | so in this context right now it's just |
| 26:20 | this so first in any type of deployment |
| 26:22 | to hosting we do this command first npm |
| 26:26 | run build enter remember that little |
| 26:28 | cheat sheet make sure you have that make |
| 26:30 | sure to add this to your cheat sheet |
| 26:32 | it's build it out this is built out our |
| 26:34 | optimized version of our front end now |
| 26:36 | let's deploy it to a live link simply |
| 26:38 | put in the command Firebase deploy enter |
| 26:41 | there we go that's a live website link |
| 26:44 | you go to that website it exists on the |
| 26:46 | internet you can share with your friends |
| 26:48 | Etc let's try it so for example I go to |
| 26:50 | the hosting URL here click it now I |
| 26:53 | realized that there was one little issue |
| 26:55 | here so when you deployed that you may |
| 26:56 | have gotten a white screen don't worry |
| 26:58 | the issue here is that when we go to our |
| 26:59 | fireb base. Json we need to make sure |
| 27:01 | we're building to the correct area so |
| 27:03 | instead of public we're going do build |
| 27:05 | command save let me show you a little |
| 27:06 | trick here we can actually run both |
| 27:08 | these commands simultaneously in order |
| 27:11 | to do so just copy both at the same time |
| 27:13 | and hit enter mpm run build come back |
| 27:16 | over here Firebase deploy what this is |
| 27:17 | going to do is first build out our front |
| 27:19 | end and then build out our back end hit |
| 27:21 | enter boom so all I really expect to see |
| 27:23 | here is what we saw in our react |
| 27:26 | application earlier let's check it out |
| 27:28 | and there we go look up there to the URL |
| 27:31 | you'll notice this is a live website |
| 27:32 | link by the time you see this I probably |
| 27:34 | deprecated it so you probably couldn't |
| 27:36 | access it who knows the idea is this you |
| 27:38 | got it you're good to go now you can add |
| 27:40 | custom domains if you want to do so |
| 27:42 | you're going to Simply come back to your |
| 27:43 | Firebase project here and hit add custom |
| 27:45 | domain now there is a ton of other stuff |
| 27:46 | I could do on this but you successfully |
| 27:48 | completed this huge huge tutorial as I |
