| 00:00 | Jimmy car welcome to the show thank you |
| 00:02 | very much I'm uh I'm a big fan of it I'm |
| 00:04 | kind of nervous about talking to you in |
| 00:06 | a weird way because I like the show I I |
| 00:09 | really like you as a kind of cultural um |
| 00:13 | entity I think it's a really interesting |
| 00:15 | kind of Journey you've had and I get so |
| 00:17 | much from this show you know that phrase |
| 00:19 | I think you use it probably more than |
| 00:21 | any other phrase does it grow corn and |
| 00:24 | for me this show really kind of grows |
| 00:26 | corn there's so many little things that |
| 00:28 | I've taken from this that I've kind of |
| 00:30 | on oh I'm going to I'm going to do that |
| 00:31 | I'm going to do something with that so |
| 00:33 | kind of the the practical application of |
| 00:36 | the wisdom what you get out of people |
| 00:38 | seems to be um very easy to integrate |
| 00:41 | into life right so the bar's being set |
| 00:42 | high for you today then if you start |
| 00:46 | around well I mean around is |
| 00:47 | sort of what I do so the other thing is |
| 00:49 | like I I kind of get more nervous being |
| 00:51 | myself than being sort of the comedic um |
| 00:55 | Persona you know just being funny just |
| 00:57 | being on things being funny I find very |
| 00:59 | easy it's a it's an interesting sort of |
| 01:02 | Life Lesson the idea of like what do you |
| 01:03 | find easy that other people find |
| 01:05 | difficult go for that do that for a |
| 01:07 | living that's that's there's there's |
| 01:09 | going to be money there there's going to |
| 01:10 | be there's going to be some gold you're |
| 01:12 | going to be okay if you find it easy and |
| 01:13 | everyone else is going that's impossible |
| 01:15 | so you standing up in front of people |
| 01:16 | being funny I find very easy like these |
| 01:19 | kind of conversations I slightly you |
| 01:21 | slightly second guess yourself it's what |
| 01:23 | you're used to I think it's what you |
| 01:24 | spend a lot of time becoming |
| 01:26 | acclimatized to doing yeah I suppose you |
| 01:29 | know it's just that thing of I've always |
| 01:30 | said in comedy people sort of talk about |
| 01:32 | how many years they've been doing comedy |
| 01:33 | and it seems faintly ridiculous it's |
| 01:35 | kind of it's like when you talk to an |
| 01:37 | airline pilot they've got a really good |
| 01:38 | view on it they talk about how many |
| 01:39 | hours they've got in the sky and for me |
| 01:41 | like there's no substitute for um stage |
| 01:45 | time and I'm sure for you there's no |
| 01:46 | substitute for for this for actually |
| 01:48 | doing it everything else is is kind of |
| 01:51 | it doesn't matter how many years you've |
| 01:52 | had a podcast I think something about |
| 01:53 | the frequency of your show as well it's |
| 01:56 | the it's kind of it's always there |
| 01:57 | there's always something |
| 01:58 | new you talk about the most important |
| 02:01 | question to ask yourself being what do |
| 02:04 | you want yeah I mean I talk about that |
| 02:06 | an awful lot I I studied a lot of uh |
| 02:08 | studied and was very interested in sort |
| 02:10 | of NLP and that question of what do you |
| 02:12 | want in the micro in the macro being um |
| 02:17 | being the absolute key in sort of life |
| 02:19 | because people sort of um I suppose it's |
| 02:22 | it's it's that thing of going what does |
| 02:23 | something represent people someone might |
| 02:25 | say well I want a |
| 02:27 | Ferrari um but why if you if you sort of |
| 02:30 | dig a little deep you can't just ask |
| 02:31 | once what do you want well I want a |
| 02:32 | Ferrari and a Rolex and all of the |
| 02:34 | trappings but actually what they want is |
| 02:37 | status so it's kind of asking yourself |
| 02:40 | what game are you going to play I've |
| 02:42 | read a lot of that um uh Rene Gerard uh |
| 02:45 | stuff about sort of memetic desires so |
| 02:47 | this idea that you've got what you |
| 02:49 | really want at kind of a a fundamental |
| 02:52 | level it's about you and what you |
| 02:55 | perceive you should have compared to |
| 02:57 | others so this idea of kind of being |
| 02:59 | honest about what you want and why you |
| 03:01 | want it well splitting apart what is a |
| 03:04 | genuine desire that's come from you |
| 03:06 | that's been |
| 03:08 | self-authored and what is just the |
| 03:11 | things that you've taken from the way |
| 03:13 | you dealt with past trauma and what your |
| 03:15 | parents valued and what society says |
| 03:17 | that you should and the paths of least |
| 03:19 | resistance and your genetic |
| 03:21 | predisposition this beautiful quote that |
| 03:24 | says ultimately happiness comes down to |
| 03:27 | choosing between the discomfort of |
| 03:29 | becoming aware of our mental afflictions |
| 03:31 | and the discomfort of becoming ruled by |
| 03:33 | them and it's this yeah that's it's a |
| 03:35 | lot though isn't it I mean it's like I |
| 03:37 | don't think anyone gets there by the way |
| 03:39 | I think there's there's kind there's |
| 03:40 | slightly I think sometimes when I hear |
| 03:42 | people kind of interview talking about |
| 03:43 | this stuff there's a there's a sense of |
| 03:46 | oh well you know I'm enlightened now and |
| 03:47 | I know knowing that you you know you |
| 03:50 | only want that thing because you've got |
| 03:52 | that thing and I want the new iPhone |
| 03:54 | because you've got the new iPhone |
| 03:56 | knowing that doesn't really make any |
| 03:57 | difference because when you're out there |
| 03:59 | in the world you still got to live a |
| 04:01 | life and do something correct but it's |
| 04:02 | about what uh that will store book I |
| 04:05 | thought was phenomenal um the status |
| 04:08 | game I mean all these books are great |
| 04:10 | actually he's a really interesting sort |
| 04:12 | of underrated wrer he's wonderful but |
| 04:14 | that thing of like going well actually |
| 04:16 | you pick what status game you play in |
| 04:18 | you can have anything you can't have |
| 04:21 | everything it's that thing of just the |
| 04:23 | the words seem to be very important to |
| 04:25 | me the idea of saying um you can work |
| 04:28 | for anything in life to a kid as as you |
| 04:31 | can have anything is the difference |
| 04:33 | between um you know ambition and |
| 04:36 | entitlement in you know summed up was |
| 04:38 | that lovely thing you sent out the other |
| 04:40 | day yes that you know that the |
| 04:42 | difference between ambition and um |
| 04:44 | entitlement being you know ambition |
| 04:47 | ambition is when you expect yourself to |
| 04:49 | close the gap between what you have and |
| 04:51 | what you want entitlement is when you |
| 04:53 | expect others to close the gap between |
| 04:55 | what you have and what you want yeah |
| 04:57 | that thing of like agency see |
| 05:00 | seems that's very high on my list of |
| 05:02 | like getting back to what do you want |
| 05:04 | agency I want the um I want control to |
| 05:07 | be in here like I think it's better to |
| 05:10 | be a standup I mean the thing I've been |
| 05:12 | thinking about recently is um being |
| 05:14 | stoic doing less better being a stand-up |
| 05:17 | is a great job and there's so many |
| 05:19 | stand-ups that get the job of being a |
| 05:20 | standup and then they want to be an |
| 05:22 | actor and you I go you're mad that's |
| 05:25 | it's not as good a job it's better to do |
| 05:27 | a podcast than to have a TV show |
| 05:30 | and because you're in charge you're Your |
| 05:32 | Own Boss you you know kind of whe you |
| 05:34 | know cancel proof not you'd be |
| 05:35 | particularly bothered about that but the |
| 05:37 | idea of going you're in charge and |
| 05:38 | you've got agency and you can do what |
| 05:39 | you want well there's a level there's a |
| 05:41 | huge power to that there's a level of |
| 05:43 | narcissism I think that comes with |
| 05:46 | believing that you would be able to beat |
| 05:50 | somebody else at them doing one thing |
| 05:52 | while you're doing two things okay so |
| 05:55 | you think that you're going to be a |
| 05:56 | better podcaster than the guy that just |
| 05:57 | does a podcast whilst trying to do a |
| 05:59 | podcast and run a business and be on TV |
| 06:02 | and fly around the world do all of these |
| 06:04 | it's also that thing of like going if |
| 06:06 | your aim is sort of happiness I think |
| 06:08 | having a process driven ambition rather |
| 06:12 | than an outcom driven ambition like what |
| 06:14 | do you want to do rather than what you |
| 06:16 | want to be you know so that idea of |
| 06:18 | going look you do a podcast and you live |
| 06:20 | for it it seems to be pretty much all |
| 06:23 | you care about and you're loving it and |
| 06:25 | you you you kind of embody that and it's |
| 06:27 | it gets back to that Nal thing of like |
| 06:29 | what's play for you what's easy for you |
| 06:32 | what's play what's just what's fun no |
| 06:34 | one's going to put this effort in look |
| 06:35 | around look at the 4K cameras or |
| 06:37 | whatever the no one's putting this |
| 06:38 | effort in that doesn't really care about |
| 06:40 | it so someone trying to fake it and go |
| 06:42 | well I want what he's getting for that I |
| 06:44 | want the ad Revenue it's like you well |
| 06:47 | no that's the you're playing in the |
| 06:48 | wrong game there's a a really great |
| 06:50 | quote from Mark Manson where he talks |
| 06:51 | about the most important question to ask |
| 06:53 | yourself is what pain are you willing to |
| 06:55 | endure in your life rather than what |
| 06:56 | pleasure do you want because any |
| 06:58 | pleasure or any Pursuit that you want is |
| 07:00 | going to come with an in-kind payment of |
| 07:02 | pain even your stuff the the fatigue the |
| 07:05 | the road everything else but that thing |
| 07:07 | of like you know the the all self-help |
| 07:09 | is hard choices now Easy Life later |
| 07:13 | everything is the marshmallow test |
| 07:14 | everything is about saying look you know |
| 07:16 | that famous marshmallow test of give a |
| 07:18 | kid you can have one marshmallow now or |
| 07:20 | two later that seems to be a really good |
| 07:22 | indicator in life of going what are you |
| 07:24 | willing to and and and work really is |
| 07:28 | work is the sacrifice for later and it's |
| 07:31 | it's really about that time frame |
| 07:33 | probably the biggest thing I got from |
| 07:34 | this show uh and from following you was |
| 07:38 | that idea of serving yourself in 24 |
| 07:40 | hours you have to serve someone what are |
| 07:42 | you going to do today that you tomorrow |
| 07:46 | will appreciate yeah because for |
| 07:48 | something about a day seems about the |
| 07:50 | right time frame like if it's if it's in |
| 07:52 | six months time and you're trying to go |
| 07:54 | to the gym and motivate yourself by I'm |
| 07:55 | going to look great in six months it's |
| 07:56 | like ah I don't know I don't know if |
| 07:59 | you're going to do that I I don't think |
| 08:01 | that's a motivator because it's written |
| 08:02 | on my fridge what would you tomorrow |
| 08:04 | want you today to do it's written on my |
| 08:06 | fridge it's a great I think there's a |
| 08:07 | book in that I I think genuine I think |
| 08:09 | it's such a a powerful you've got me |
| 08:11 | writing you have told me to write five |
| 08:14 | different books over the last week that |
| 08:15 | we've spent together but I like the idea |
| 08:17 | of that thing of going because it's it's |
| 08:19 | you know you listen to a podcast but the |
| 08:21 | book seems to be the book and the course |
| 08:22 | seems to be the thing that it's just a |
| 08:24 | way of getting all of your thoughts on |
| 08:26 | this together treatment yeah um but I |
| 08:30 | think that idea of like your the you |
| 08:32 | know what are you going to do that's |
| 08:33 | going to make you happy in 24 hours and |
| 08:36 | that's really about saying well your |
| 08:38 | Ambitions should be um feelings not |
| 08:42 | things what's the difference well the |
| 08:45 | idea that you go well how do I want to |
| 08:46 | feel is something that you go well |
| 08:48 | that's that's an ambition you have I |
| 08:50 | want to feel happy I want to feel |
| 08:51 | contented I want to feel healthy I want |
| 08:53 | to feel fulfilled uh wanting those |
| 08:55 | things wanting material things well the |
| 08:57 | reason you want the material thing is to |
| 08:59 | give you the feeling so just cut out the |
| 09:01 | middleman yeah I mean listen it's easy |
| 09:03 | for me to say I'm rich famous |
| 09:05 | baby you know it's like it's slightly |
| 09:08 | that thing of like where you're calling |
| 09:10 | from but you you just realize there's |
| 09:12 | just more stuff over dinner you spoke |
| 09:15 | about the difference between jealousy |
| 09:17 | and envy and I thought that that was |
| 09:19 | really interesting well I think that |
| 09:21 | it's a conception where I don't really |
| 09:22 | mind which word you use but Envy for me |
| 09:26 | is is good because it tells you what you |
| 09:28 | want |
| 09:30 | so if you see someone and they've got a |
| 09:32 | terrific physique and you go oh I want |
| 09:33 | to I want to look like that guy that |
| 09:35 | tells you what you want that's that's |
| 09:37 | great when you see someone with a uh I |
| 09:39 | don't know a um a beautiful girl and you |
| 09:42 | don't want him to have it but you don't |
| 09:45 | want it that strikes me that is a very |
| 09:48 | uh that's kind of um bitterness and |
| 09:50 | resentment and it's it's mean and it's |
| 09:53 | it's that that I think it's a it's a |
| 09:56 | it's a nich quote isn't it if you um uh |
| 09:59 | resentment is when you think someone has |
| 10:01 | ruined your life and there is someone |
| 10:03 | that's ruined your life it's |
| 10:06 | you so that's really I find that very |
| 10:08 | powerful the idea that's the agentic |
| 10:10 | frame again right that you're taking |
| 10:12 | control of that when you realize that it |
| 10:15 | is you that's been in control of most of |
| 10:17 | the things that have gone on that's |
| 10:19 | taking agency that's taking |
| 10:21 | responsibility but I think that we're |
| 10:23 | we're sort of set up not to do that |
| 10:24 | right we we're set like and as the |
| 10:26 | economy changes as our world changes I |
| 10:28 | think theide idea of getting a job is is |
| 10:31 | a little bit you know become slightly |
| 10:33 | Nanny State it's like well I'll get a |
| 10:35 | job and they'll pay me and then they |
| 10:37 | they'll worry about that and I'll just |
| 10:38 | do this job for them and it's like this |
| 10:40 | idea of like new jobs are happening all |
| 10:42 | the time it feels like there's a there's |
| 10:44 | a new economy kind of sprouting up and |
| 10:46 | people are doing their own thing it |
| 10:47 | feels like it's not just comedians I |
| 10:49 | mean obviously I'm uh very bought into |
| 10:52 | the being a standup comedian world but |
| 10:54 | people are doing their own thing it's |
| 10:55 | lovely yeah I I wonder talking about the |
| 10:59 | skill acquisition thing obviously the |
| 11:01 | pace that you tour at how many shows |
| 11:03 | have you done this year so far 220 |
| 11:06 | something like that and there's probably |
| 11:07 | been about 250 to 280 days so far this |
| 11:12 | year yeah something like that but I make |
| 11:13 | TV shows as well so you know I keep busy |
| 11:18 | but it's you know but really if you |
| 11:19 | compare it to someone with a real job |
| 11:21 | it's not that much work because the way |
| 11:23 | that I perceive it is I work for you |
| 11:24 | know 2 hours or 4 hours a night |
| 11:26 | depending on how many shows and in most |
| 11:29 | people work 8 hours now there's a bit of |
| 11:30 | travel involved and stuff but it's it's |
| 11:33 | it's a pleasure if you find something |
| 11:34 | you love doing you never work again |
| 11:35 | that's the well I suppose if you look at |
| 11:38 | that's such a good frame to say wow 250 |
| 11:41 | days of the year or 220 days of the year |
| 11:43 | and there's only been 280 days or |
| 11:45 | whatever okay well if you were to roll |
| 11:47 | that forward for any normal 9 to-5 |
| 11:50 | person that's that's probably the right |
| 11:52 | number of days or maybe even a little |
| 11:54 | bit less and there's something about |
| 11:57 | taking a working class spit and sawdust |
| 12:00 | mentality into the realm where it it |
| 12:04 | doesn't seem like it's it's supposed to |
| 12:06 | be there where you actually end up |
| 12:08 | seeing disproportionate returns yeah I |
| 12:10 | suppose it's that thing of like it's |
| 12:13 | uh it's really about what you're willing |
| 12:15 | to put in as well like if you find |
| 12:16 | something that you love doing well why |
| 12:18 | would you want to stop doing that just |
| 12:19 | do do more of that and you get better it |
| 12:23 | is that thing where you go it's time in |
| 12:24 | the gym it seems that stress is very |
| 12:26 | good for us in in all areas you know |
| 12:30 | going to the gym is stressing your body |
| 12:31 | and working and coming up with new stuff |
| 12:34 | is you know you're stressing yourself |
| 12:36 | you know so that thing of like trying to |
| 12:37 | you know trying new stuff at every show |
| 12:40 | it's only you know you saw the show the |
| 12:41 | other night it's only a five minute bit |
| 12:42 | where I get out a pit of paper and try |
| 12:44 | some new jokes but that bit means that |
| 12:46 | the next tour is very easy because five |
| 12:48 | minutes at every show you you sort of |
| 12:51 | Bank a lot of stuff a bank a lot of new |
| 12:52 | ideas and you have a reason to think |
| 12:55 | about the new thing always you have a |
| 12:57 | reason to be thinking about okay what's |
| 12:59 | the new thing what's the new thing |
| 13:00 | what's a new idea for a joke what AM we |
| 13:02 | going to try tonight well that's a big |
| 13:04 | hack I think you know it's the fan |
| 13:06 | technique in order to be able to learn |
| 13:07 | it you must first be able to teach it |
| 13:09 | type thing but there's an equivalent |
| 13:12 | when it comes to personal growth as well |
| 13:14 | I think which is the best way to ensure |
| 13:19 | that you're going to continue to develop |
| 13:20 | is to have an outlet where it's going to |
| 13:22 | be scrutinized by other people like so |
| 13:25 | much of the learning and the reading and |
| 13:26 | the stuff that I do is exclusive because |
| 13:29 | I know that I need to be remotely |
| 13:31 | interesting or prepared for the next |
| 13:32 | guest that comes on well it's that it is |
| 13:35 | that thing where you go the joy of |
| 13:36 | standup comedy the feedback loop is it's |
| 13:38 | so quick I mean people just immedi and |
| 13:40 | and an audience you Lenny Bruce first |
| 13:42 | said it the audience is a genius they |
| 13:44 | know immediately that's funny that's not |
| 13:46 | funny that's acceptable that's not |
| 13:48 | acceptable they make the call on all |
| 13:50 | that stuff so you're just like |
| 13:52 | presenting stuff and going is that okay |
| 13:53 | is that all right I mean you know it's |
| 13:55 | it's really easy because you just you |
| 13:57 | write I've written so many more jokes |
| 14:00 | that don't work than you so many more |
| 14:03 | like thousands more it's that Edison |
| 14:05 | thing about I haven't failed I just |
| 14:07 | found 10,000 ways that I wasn't |
| 14:10 | successful yeah and you but you |
| 14:12 | eventually get to it and then you go |
| 14:14 | well you what's what's the stand-up |
| 14:15 | comedian kind of superpower it's an hour |
| 14:18 | maybe 90 minutes if you go and see a |
| 14:20 | live show cuz there a bit of stuff as |
| 14:21 | well but you know putting together |
| 14:23 | specials and you go right it's it's |
| 14:25 | that's kind of the best of me over the |
| 14:27 | last 18 months that's all the funny |
| 14:29 | stuff I I said in the last 18 months and |
| 14:31 | that's there for you I think it's more |
| 14:34 | relevant than music I think music is |
| 14:36 | incredibly important and should be |
| 14:39 | taught more in schools but I think |
| 14:40 | standup should be a course in schools |
| 14:42 | you think about what it's about it's |
| 14:43 | about verbal dexterity right and it's |
| 14:46 | about being able to express yourself and |
| 14:48 | it's about finding your voice and |
| 14:50 | expressing who you are and it's a |
| 14:53 | perspective on life where you're seeing |
| 14:56 | the lighter side and trying to find fun |
| 14:58 | in something that you know there's two |
| 15:00 | stories you know one story is about a |
| 15:02 | guy um himself on a train and |
| 15:06 | it's just a it's like ah I had the worst |
| 15:09 | day ever and then there's some |
| 15:10 | perspective where you go that's the |
| 15:11 | funniest story I've ever heard there's |
| 15:14 | there's something about the ability of a |
| 15:16 | comedian to kind of shift perspectives |
| 15:18 | and for me comedy has a function in |
| 15:20 | society that no one is calling which is |
| 15:23 | it's the we're pushing the Overton |
| 15:26 | window we we're always at the edge of |
| 15:29 | what is and what isn't acceptable like |
| 15:31 | no I'm not just talking about like I |
| 15:33 | happen to tell edgy jokes that's not |
| 15:36 | what this is It's I'm seeing things as |
| 15:39 | they are but kind of with new eyes |
| 15:42 | that's sort of what Comics do even the |
| 15:43 | most kind of mainstream observational |
| 15:46 | comedy have done well you're sort of |
| 15:48 | questioning the reality you're saying |
| 15:49 | well this is this is uh this is not |
| 15:52 | normal this is not how things should be |
| 15:54 | this is weird am I the only one thinking |
| 15:56 | this is it just me that kind of Trope of |
| 15:59 | comedy and it pushes what we what we |
| 16:01 | think about the world it pushes what's |
| 16:03 | acceptable Progressive you said that |
| 16:06 | comedians are often ahead of the curve |
| 16:07 | on social issues I think they are I |
| 16:09 | think like comedians really do kind |
| 16:12 | of it's the canary in the mine it's the |
| 16:15 | sort of test in the air of what you can |
| 16:16 | say and you know politics lags |
| 16:19 | behind and so does culture you know if |
| 16:22 | you want to know what are going to be |
| 16:24 | the biggest talking points amongst |
| 16:27 | normal people in about 18 months time |
| 16:29 | look at the jokes that comedians are |
| 16:31 | making today well I think there's a |
| 16:32 | there's a there's a argument to be said |
| 16:34 | that comedy lives in sort of a space |
| 16:36 | between public and private discourse and |
| 16:38 | it strikes me that there's never been a |
| 16:41 | wider gap between public and private |
| 16:43 | discourse what people are saying in bars |
| 16:46 | and homes and on social media to their |
| 16:48 | friends and and what the party line you |
| 16:52 | know you sort of the party line's pretty |
| 16:54 | strong at the moment on what you can and |
| 16:56 | what you can't say you know if you want |
| 16:57 | to see where power really lives what |
| 17:00 | can't you |
| 17:03 | say it's interesting right what can't |
| 17:06 | you say in a society what isn't |
| 17:08 | acceptable in the world you get into |
| 17:09 | very interesting topics I mean all the |
| 17:11 | stuff you talk about on Modern wisdom |
| 17:13 | falls into that sort of category of |
| 17:15 | going what should we talk about this you |
| 17:17 | know you talk about you know whether |
| 17:19 | it's environmentalism or gender or or |
| 17:21 | you know what's what's happening in the |
| 17:22 | world it's very it's very interesting to |
| 17:23 | kind of call that and to to mess around |
| 17:26 | with it so it's actually it's kind of a |
| 17:27 | great space |
| 17:29 | and comedy it sugar the pill as well you |
| 17:31 | you know it's it's almost the perfect |
| 17:34 | drug for me standup comedy because it's |
| 17:36 | the dopamine here if you don't quite |
| 17:38 | know where the line is going to come and |
| 17:40 | it's the serotonin pleasure of laughter |
| 17:42 | and going out to a live show has that |
| 17:45 | incredible sort of effect on people of |
| 17:48 | it it's a physical response I'm you know |
| 17:51 | I've said it before I I think of myself |
| 17:53 | as a drug dealer but you have the drugs |
| 17:55 | on |
| 17:55 | you that's so nice you know You' you've |
| 17:58 | got everything on you but I'm able to |
| 18:00 | sort of tease it out so I can get across |
| 18:02 | borders with no |
| 18:04 | problem it's interesting isn't it like |
| 18:06 | the best drug in the world what's the |
| 18:07 | best drug in the |
| 18:08 | world I would love to know what the |
| 18:12 | hormonal Cascade of someone listening to |
| 18:14 | a great podcast is feeling I'm going to |
| 18:16 | guess that there would be a good chunk |
| 18:17 | of Serotonin and maybe some dopamine |
| 18:19 | from I've realized something or his two |
| 18:21 | ideas that I didn't see before and |
| 18:22 | they've been tied together and they've |
| 18:24 | been wrapped up in a bow and interesting |
| 18:26 | the dopamine thing the thing that we |
| 18:27 | were discussing the other that I found |
| 18:28 | very interesting was like the idea that |
| 18:30 | you could go if you had one data point |
| 18:32 | on someone their view on abortion let's |
| 18:34 | say what else could you what else could |
| 18:37 | you figure out from that correct you |
| 18:39 | know so the the modern day I suppose it |
| 18:41 | would be modern day cold |
| 18:43 | reading right so if you know old school |
| 18:45 | cold reading was you know someone at a |
| 18:47 | sance going is anyone lost a |
| 18:49 | Mary in Catholic Island I mean |
| 18:51 | throw a |
| 18:53 | stone but the idea this kind of modern |
| 18:55 | day called reading on what do you what |
| 18:56 | do you think about brexit someone tells |
| 18:57 | you and you go I know everything that I |
| 18:59 | need to know about you yeah from that |
| 19:01 | one data so it's with podcast it's the |
| 19:04 | thing is it's about the dopamine of |
| 19:05 | going when does someone surprise you |
| 19:07 | with their view dude I I so after our |
| 19:09 | conversation we went for dinner on |
| 19:10 | Thursday and then I wrote my newsletter |
| 19:13 | based off of the inspiration from that |
| 19:15 | such a good way to judge whether or not |
| 19:19 | the content creator that you are |
| 19:20 | listening to is acting |
| 19:22 | genuinely and taking their insights from |
| 19:26 | what they truly are interested in and |
| 19:28 | being honest is when was the last time |
| 19:31 | that they surprised you with something |
| 19:32 | that they said yeah the the honesty is |
| 19:35 | really interesting because it's it's |
| 19:37 | weird being a comic because everything I |
| 19:38 | say on stage is a lie ultimately jokes |
| 19:40 | are little lies but Comics leak there's |
| 19:43 | a weird thing you can watch someone on |
| 19:44 | stage or watch you know your favorite |
| 19:46 | comic or whatever and you kind of have a |
| 19:47 | sense of who they are it just it just |
| 19:49 | happens you don't really choose your |
| 19:51 | style as a comic it kind of chooses you |
| 19:54 | it's kind it's who you are it's really |
| 19:56 | it's kind of an interesting the |
| 19:57 | caricature of the self well not even a |
| 19:59 | caricature I think there's something |
| 20:00 | about it's it's very authentic and |
| 20:02 | there's something about podcasting |
| 20:04 | especially the long form shows you can't |
| 20:06 | hide there's nowhere for you to hide so |
| 20:08 | the thing that I found kind of |
| 20:10 | fascinating about your journey um and I |
| 20:13 | you know my only critique of your show |
| 20:15 | is I don't think you ever talk about |
| 20:16 | yourself enough because it's you're |
| 20:19 | fabulous at listening and teasing things |
| 20:22 | out people and and holding a space but |
| 20:24 | you never really talk about your journey |
| 20:27 | and maybe you did in the very early |
| 20:29 | episodes and I missed them but the idea |
| 20:30 | of like going to go from a guy on love |
| 20:34 | Island running clubs to this strikes me |
| 20:38 | as a I mean you talk about agency you |
| 20:41 | you basically kind of invented a job |
| 20:42 | that didn't really exist wasn't really a |
| 20:45 | thing and and now of course you know it |
| 20:47 | is and you know everyone's got a podcast |
| 20:50 | but not like this yeah yeah it's |
| 20:52 | interesting I guess you know whenever I |
| 20:54 | sit down with someone for a long time |
| 20:56 | when you start a show you're writing on |
| 20:57 | the coattails if whoever is in front of |
| 20:58 | you you know I'm riding on the coils of |
| 21:00 | Rory Sutherland or Jordan Peterson or |
| 21:02 | Douglas Murray or whoever and |
| 21:05 | then I'm always really interested in |
| 21:07 | just making the show an amazing platform |
| 21:12 | and trampoline for the guest if I walk |
| 21:14 | away with the guest shining as much as |
| 21:17 | possible that's that's a good day at the |
| 21:18 | office for me I made this as energetic |
| 21:23 | or sedate or thoughtful or exciting or |
| 21:27 | whatever as needed to be to get the best |
| 21:30 | insights out of this spectacular person |
| 21:32 | who's very interesting and I want to |
| 21:33 | learn from that's a good day at the |
| 21:35 | office and it always inevitably puts me |
| 21:38 | in the back seat but that's how I |
| 21:39 | designed it right I designed it to not |
| 21:41 | be it's not called the Chris Williamson |
| 21:43 | show right it's called modern wisdom |
| 21:46 | because I wanted to be the most |
| 21:48 | interesting people the smartest thinkers |
| 21:50 | on the planet what have they got to say |
| 21:52 | life is hard and this show should |
| 21:54 | help that's where it is that being said |
| 21:57 | I know that after a while sort of the |
| 21:59 | cult of personality starts to kick in |
| 22:01 | and you think oh well people actually |
| 22:02 | want now not just to know about them but |
| 22:04 | to know about you I've got this |
| 22:06 | live show happening where it's me on |
| 22:07 | stage for nearly two hours just me yeah |
| 22:12 | that's Terri how's that how are you |
| 22:13 | finding the because you did the first |
| 22:15 | one on Saturday right I had a dry run |
| 22:17 | yeah assisted by some words of wisdom |
| 22:19 | from you the night before um it was good |
| 22:22 | I really enjoyed it scary I don't know |
| 22:24 | how you guys do it uh what do you mean |
| 22:26 | you just did it but it's different what |
| 22:28 | I do is I just get to Waffle what you |
| 22:30 | have to do is this unbelievably 0% fat |
| 22:33 | lean down to the nothing but muscle |
| 22:37 |  bodybuilder presentation up on |
| 22:39 | stage I don't know I think it's I think |
| 22:40 | it's you know what are people looking |
| 22:42 | for really I mean with laughter they're |
| 22:44 | looking for uh it's a it's a it's a it's |
| 22:46 | a response you could kind of measure you |
| 22:48 | look at laughs per minute and go well |
| 22:49 | you're doing a great job because you're |
| 22:50 | getting the laughs per minute but |
| 22:51 | ultimately they're coming out to be part |
| 22:52 | of a crowd they could watch it at home |
| 22:54 | on Netflix but they're coming out to see |
| 22:56 | a show because they want to feel |
| 22:57 | connected what are you offering |
| 22:59 | connection people want to feel connected |
| 23:01 | and you're standing on stage and you're |
| 23:02 | saying well you're giving of yourself |
| 23:04 | here's what I learned here's what I |
| 23:05 | think and you know hopefully they they |
| 23:09 | feel like they're they're with |
| 23:11 | like-minded people they're in a room |
| 23:13 | Collective fence I think it's Tribal |
| 23:15 | isn't it it's that idea that we're we |
| 23:17 | sort of there's an illusion that we're |
| 23:19 | individuals I really like that line |
| 23:20 | there's um there's no such thing as a |
| 23:24 | baby it's always a baby and someone |
| 23:26 | caring for the baby it's a baby and a |
| 23:28 | mother baby and a father baby and a |
| 23:29 | family the babies don't exist on their |
| 23:31 | own we're all babies we all takes a |
| 23:35 | village you know if you look around |
| 23:37 | behind the cameras at the other people |
| 23:38 | that are just in the room right now |
| 23:39 | never mind the other people that work on |
| 23:41 | the podcast the idea that a standup is |
| 23:42 | standing on stage on his own it's an |
| 23:44 | illusion it's a very pleasing illusion |
| 23:47 | because we're in our heads a lot of the |
| 23:48 | time but we are searching for community |
| 23:51 | in a space where that's sort of been |
| 23:54 | lost you know that the idea that we're |
| 23:57 | kind of we've never been more connected |
| 23:58 | and never felt more alienated because |
| 24:01 | it's about the depth of the connection |
| 24:03 | in other news this episode is brought to |

| 25:01 | slod wisdom we spoke the other night |
| 25:03 | about the problems of the |
| 25:05 | self you have a problem or there are |
| 25:07 | there are many problems that are |
| 25:09 | associated with this obsession with the |
| 25:11 | self and the rise of the individual well |
| 25:14 | I think that's you know that's the yeah |
| 25:16 | it's it strikes me that it's uh if you |
| 25:18 | if you look at different communities |
| 25:20 | around the world you can sort of see |
| 25:22 | where the C communities where the self |
| 25:24 | is uh |
| 25:26 | is sacran and there's other places where |
| 25:30 | not so much uh you know it's much more |
| 25:32 | tribal I mean it's kind of an |
| 25:33 | interesting thought my favorite quote of |
| 25:35 | all time is William Gibson the future is |
| 25:37 | here but it's not evenly |
| 25:40 | distributed and you think wow like yeah |
| 25:43 | of course what does that mean to you |
| 25:45 | well it means that there's a Utopia in |
| 25:48 | the world I'm I'm a very positive person |
| 25:49 | I mean I really do think the world is |
| 25:51 | great and we're going to crack it I |
| 25:52 | think we may have already solved most of |
| 25:54 | the problems in the world but in in in |
| 25:57 | just particular areas right so you know |
| 26:01 | so you go to Portugal let's say go to |
| 26:03 | Lisbon now and the drug laws changed 15 |
| 26:05 | years ago they legalized all drugs said |
| 26:07 | all drugs are legal and we're going to |
| 26:09 | take all the money we were spending on |
| 26:10 | fighting uh the War on Drugs which would |
| 26:13 | just patently losing we're going to take |
| 26:15 | all that money and we're going to spend |
| 26:16 | it on rehabs and we're going to spend it |
| 26:18 | on education and we're going to spend it |
| 26:20 | on uh making it easier for people to |
| 26:23 | make good |
| 26:24 | choices great and it worked you walk |
| 26:27 | around Lisbon now one of the safest |
| 26:28 | cities in Europe it's magnificent it's |
| 26:30 | bug buzzing it's it's fabulous you go |
| 26:34 | that's that's a brilliant idea why don't |
| 26:37 | we just take that and do that here it |
| 26:39 | seems to work because you know the |
| 26:42 | altern people sort of go yeah but you |
| 26:43 | know drugs aren't good and drugs I agree |
| 26:45 | I don't do drugs it's not my thing and |
| 26:47 | some people have got real issues around |
| 26:49 | them but you go but what we're doing at |
| 26:50 | the moment isn't working and that seems |
| 26:52 | to work and then you'll always have a |
| 26:54 | very small percentage of people that |
| 26:55 | have you know real problems and that's |
| 26:57 | fine but but at least if you know those |
| 26:59 | people aren't criminalized then they |
| 27:01 | don't most petty crime is drug related |
| 27:03 | so you that's a problem that's been |
| 27:05 | fixed we could just take that I think |
| 27:07 | the energy crisis have been |
| 27:09 | solved but only on nuclear |
| 27:12 | submarines nuclear submarines strike me |
| 27:14 | as that's there why is no one talking |
| 27:17 | about these people are living in tubes |
| 27:19 | with a nuclear reactor and they have |
| 27:20 | been for 50 years we've tested it and |
| 27:24 | those guys seem fine self- sustaining |
| 27:26 | much worse environment than we've got up |
| 27:28 | here where we can breathe water and we |
| 27:29 | don't need to recirculate the carbon |
| 27:31 | dioxide and it's working right there you |
| 27:34 | go there's the I mean I'm ABS I'm with |
| 27:36 | Extinction Rebellion I think there is an |
| 27:38 | environmental crisis it's awful but I |
| 27:40 | don't think the person that solves the |
| 27:41 | problem is I don't think we say in 50 |
| 27:43 | years time we came pretty close there to |
| 27:45 | an environmental collapse but thankfully |
| 27:48 | someone glued themselves to the top of a |
| 27:50 | car that did it I think it's going to be |
| 27:54 | a physicist that does it right it's |
| 27:56 | going to be a scientist that has a |
| 27:58 | wonderful idea and and and does |
| 28:00 | something so it's that thing if you go |
| 28:02 | what if you care about that where should |
| 28:05 | you be putting your energy and I think |
| 28:08 | it's again it comes back to where's the |
| 28:09 | agency so that you know gluing yourself |
| 28:13 | to the top of a car is is great it's |
| 28:15 | saying look I need some this is |
| 28:17 | important something needs to be done I |
| 28:19 | don't think any politician has the |
| 28:21 | vision to do it I don't think it gets |
| 28:23 | solved through a law I think it gets |
| 28:27 | solved through science and technology |
| 28:29 | and I read um uh David deutsche's uh the |
| 28:33 | beginning of infinity that was just |
| 28:35 | blown away by what if we're the first |
| 28:40 | 100 billion people that's how many |
| 28:42 | people have lived |
| 28:43 | right yeah 100 billion um I'm including |
| 28:47 | us in that yeah and it could be |
| 28:49 | trillions in the future yeah if we if we |
| 28:52 | get this right it's it's exciting right |
| 28:55 | and the idea that science is this |
| 28:57 | particular kill a meme that can you know |
| 28:59 | we've got this AI technology which |
| 29:01 | people seem scared about and you go well |
| 29:03 | maybe this is going to be the solution |
| 29:05 | people are worried about nuclear |
| 29:06 | catastrophe we've already priced in the |
| 29:08 | downside right we've priced in nuclear |
| 29:11 | war that's already a possibility why not |
| 29:14 | take the outside did you read William |
| 29:16 | MCC casal's what we owe the future did |
| 29:18 | you see that no but I I I heard people |
| 29:21 | talking about it I I haven't got around |
| 29:22 | to reading it is it is it good |
| 29:23 | interesting guy good it's it's an |
| 29:25 | important book I think to read |
| 29:26 | especially if you |
| 29:28 | tops way well that idea of like people |
| 29:30 | being people are important um temporally |
| 29:35 | and spatially yes so the idea that we're |
| 29:37 | quite obsessed with us in the west |
| 29:40 | America West Europe in our village in |
| 29:44 | our community what do we owe the future |
| 29:46 | is a very good question what do we owe |
| 29:48 | the rest of the world because the idea |
| 29:50 | that the environmental problem could be |
| 29:51 | solved by doing less and cutting back |
| 29:54 | and maybe if we live like we lived in |
| 29:55 | 1985 that could cure things |
| 29:57 | I don't think it's you know the |
| 30:00 | population's out of control I don't see |
| 30:02 | any volunteers have you heard Peter |
| 30:04 | singer's thought experiment about the |
| 30:05 | drowning |
| 30:06 | child this explains the distance thing |
| 30:10 | that you were talking about very nicely |
| 30:12 | so um you're walking down the street and |
| 30:15 | you see a drowning child in the uh River |
| 30:18 | that's next to you does sound like a set |
| 30:20 | up for a joke doesn't it it sounds like |
| 30:21 | the kind of thing I would go so I'm |
| 30:23 | walking down the street so there's a |
| 30:24 | drowning child in in a river |
| 30:28 | yes okay that's the start Peter sing is |
| 30:31 | a nice softly spoken Australian man in |
| 30:33 | his late 70s I don't think that he was |
| 30:35 | meaning it as the setup to a joke but |
| 30:36 | feel free to take it for tonight okay |
| 30:38 | you if you were to walk past and not |
| 30:40 | save the child you would be seen as |
| 30:44 | abhorent right the drowning |
| 30:45 | child you're the only person that's |
| 30:46 | around here why would you not go into |
| 30:48 | the river and go and save this kid okay |
| 30:50 | now some kids are |
| 30:52 | dicks I mean let's call it let's call it |
| 30:56 | better off do I know this kid no is it |
| 30:59 | Baby Hitler no why would it be B Baby |
| 31:01 | Hitler I don't know thought experiment |
| 31:04 | go to go to Hitler okay so go what's the |
| 31:07 | uh basically he continues to use the |
| 31:10 | distance of you okay now the |
| 31:13 | river's 100 yards away now it's 300 |
| 31:16 | yards away now it's half a mile away now |
| 31:18 | it's a mile away and the point is at |
| 31:20 | which distance does the drowning child |
| 31:24 | become less important to you and the |
| 31:26 | argu kind of is that there's no distance |
| 31:30 | it becomes an arbitrary an arbitrary |
| 31:32 | decision if you would save the child |
| 31:33 | that was there now you would save the |
| 31:35 | child that is on the other side of the |
| 31:37 | planet starving of yeah it's that you |
| 31:40 | get to that um I think quite quickly to |
| 31:42 | that uh what is it best things first the |
| 31:46 | is it BJ lomberg book about what we like |
| 31:49 | the idea the UN has got 148 things that |
| 31:52 | they want to do these are our priorities |
| 31:54 | and you go well you don't have any |
| 31:55 | priorities then cuz there's a lot of |
| 31:56 | things m what are the things that we |
| 31:57 | should do now that make a difference so |
| 31:59 | the simple stuff like mosquito Nets |
| 32:00 | really does make it makes a huge |
| 32:03 | difference what do what do you do |
| 32:05 | because you go well you |
| 32:07 | value you know your life much more than |
| 32:09 | you value someone's life in you know |
| 32:11 | it's interesting what we're not talking |
| 32:12 | about like no one talks about what's |
| 32:13 | going on in |
| 32:15 | Venezuela no one seems that bothered |
| 32:17 | about Venezuela at the moment and it's a |
| 32:20 | I don't know the phrase |
| 32:21 | shows brings to mind what's happening in |
| 32:23 | Venezuela it's you know the stories I'm |
| 32:25 | hearing is you know teenagers are |
| 32:27 | hunting cats in the |
| 32:28 | street people are dying of malnutrition |
| 32:32 | yeah it's like it's it's hell on Earth |
| 32:35 | that thing of like you know the future |
| 32:37 | is here but it's not evenly distributed |
| 32:39 | it goes back as well you can go back in |
| 32:41 | the past is still here it just hasn't |
| 32:42 | caught up yet yeah it's it's you know |
| 32:44 | there not everyone's kind of running on |
| 32:46 | the same system and maybe we should be |
| 32:50 | maybe you |
| 32:51 | know I mean we we live in an incredibly |
| 32:55 | privileged time and I'm big on gratitude |
| 32:58 | of like of the the opposite of kind of |
| 33:00 | uh bitterness and resentment the idea of |
| 33:02 | just going well what are you grateful |
| 33:04 | about and it's you can kind of it's ever |
| 33:07 | expanding the idea that like if I'd been |
| 33:09 | born in North Korea today never mind 400 |
| 33:13 | years ago but today he's really funny |
| 33:16 | he's really good at saying you know |
| 33:17 | offensive |
| 33:19 | things I wouldn't have lived to made it |
| 33:21 | to six and a half years old yeah it's |
| 33:23 | gone it's gone that's not given your |
| 33:27 | pant for being positive and for |
| 33:30 | gratitude what do you make of this |
| 33:32 | culture of cynicism that we see on the |
| 33:34 | internet fatalism nihilism |
| 33:38 | despondency um I mean it's the |
| 33:40 | internet's a problem for me |
| 33:43 | because the anonymity is is an issue um |
| 33:46 | are you with Jordan Peterson on this |
| 33:48 | what on the he says that no one no one |
| 33:50 | should have a Twitter account that |
| 33:52 | hasn't uploaded a photo of their ID I I |
| 33:54 | I kind of would think that's be an |
| 33:55 | interesting thing to try I mean what's |
| 33:58 | the argument against that that that |
| 33:59 | whistleblowers couldn't operate well I |
| 34:01 | guess whistleblowers existed before |
| 34:03 | Twitter and they used to have to go to a |
| 34:05 | paper and the paper would then print the |
| 34:07 | story that doesn't seem like a terrible |
| 34:09 | system so we go back to that and |
| 34:12 | everyone has to upload and then you go |
| 34:14 | well you can still post you can |
| 34:15 | still do all that stuff it's just it has |
| 34:17 | to be traceable to you because we are |
| 34:20 | who we are when nobody's |
| 34:23 | watching if you want to know who you |
| 34:25 | really are be on your own go somewhere |
| 34:28 | on your own on holiday or whatever and |
| 34:29 | you that's who you are if you're driving |
| 34:31 | along and you throw the soda can out of |
| 34:33 | the window of the car that's who you |
| 34:35 | really are no one does that with kids in |
| 34:37 | the back monster but if that's if that |
| 34:40 | if you do that if that's who you that's |
| 34:42 | it's interesting to kind of note that |
| 34:45 | you know it's the difference between |
| 34:46 | character and reputation you know you |
| 34:48 | really know who you are reputation is |
| 34:50 | what everyone else thinks about you you |
| 34:51 | know who you are and |
| 34:54 | yourself it's interesting to me to to |
| 34:57 | think about |
| 34:59 | how the way that we the way that we act |
| 35:02 | when nobody is looking tells us an awful |
| 35:04 | lot about |
| 35:06 | ourselves it's that adage about |
| 35:09 | um listen to how he talks about his |
| 35:11 | mother and how he treats the serving |
| 35:13 | staff at the restaurants when you're on |
| 35:15 | dates it's like a good litmus test for |
| 35:17 | the guy that you're |
| 35:19 | dating because that shows kind of who |
| 35:23 | when the stakes are incredibly low yeah |
| 35:26 | how do you show up as a |
| 35:28 | person but yeah go back the cynicism |
| 35:31 | angle what do you think's going on I I |
| 35:33 | don't know I me I suppose it's easy it's |
| 35:35 | is easy to be kind of cynical about |
| 35:37 | stuff it's also do do people not feel |
| 35:39 | like they don't have agency you know if |
| 35:41 | we as we learn more about what's going |
| 35:43 | on in the world as we you know you're |
| 35:46 | surrounded by news stories that you can |
| 35:48 | do nothing about you know Co was very |
| 35:51 | interesting for that because it actually |
| 35:52 | affected us but normally you're reading |
| 35:54 | about an earthquake happening and you go |
| 35:55 | well this what can I do what difference |
| 35:58 | does it make it's it's beyond my control |
| 36:01 | or they're fracking for oil in Alaska |
| 36:04 | okay well no one's listening to me or |
| 36:07 | they're going to war in this okay well |
| 36:09 | I'm I'm not sure I've got a a dog in |
| 36:11 | that race but and you feel very so it's |
| 36:15 | you you you kind of get cynical about it |
| 36:17 | I think people have got cynical about |
| 36:18 | politics it feels like they need big new |
| 36:22 | exciting ideas that people can get |
| 36:23 | behind and it feels like a lot of |
| 36:25 | politics is like talking about changing |
| 36:27 | this thing a tiny little bit changing |
| 36:29 | that and it's people are kind of in one |
| 36:32 | camp or the other I wonder whether the |
| 36:35 | skepticism around the legitimacy |
| 36:38 | of |
| 36:40 | Elections is born out of this sort of |
| 36:44 | sensation people have that they don't |
| 36:46 | really have any they can't contribute |
| 36:47 | and what they do doesn't matter because |
| 36:49 | that's that's the most extreme version |
| 36:52 | of it right even my vote didn't matter |
| 36:55 | even my legitimate vote didn't matter |
| 36:58 | yeah so regardless of whether or not you |
| 36:59 | think that the voting machines are |
| 37:01 | hacked or whether or not it's it's part |
| 37:03 | of some big conspiracy which it very |
| 37:05 | well may be it definitely seems like you |
| 37:08 | could sort of extrapolate forward oh |
| 37:11 | well if what I do doesn't matter at all |
| 37:15 | this is a perfectly designed |
| 37:17 | continuation of that narrative as well |
| 37:18 | so maybe people were were primed to |
| 37:21 | believe that a little bit |
| 37:23 | more yeah I mean I think it's a it's a |
| 37:25 | very interesting point to of go well if |
| 37:27 | people don't even think their vote |
| 37:28 | counts then what you do but but I guess |
| 37:31 | if you're if you're pinning your hopes |
| 37:33 | for um self-actualization on your party |
| 37:37 | getting in it's like following a |
| 37:39 | football team it's like it's a fun thing |
| 37:41 | to do but don't don't let it take over |
| 37:43 | your life you know these are 11 guys |
| 37:46 | that don't give a about you and |
| 37:48 | they're kicking a ball around it can't |
| 37:49 | be everything it can't be the whole of |
| 37:51 | your life Politics as well can't be the |
| 37:54 | whole of your life you can't hope that |
| 37:55 | that's going to bring you everything |
| 37:58 | it's you want you want a uh a better |
| 38:00 | world but how are we going to get you |
| 38:02 | know it's a good question to ask like |
| 38:03 | how do we get a better |
| 38:05 | world um how do we how do we bring the |
| 38:08 | standard of living up what do we |
| 38:10 | actually want for the |
| 38:11 | world because it's not just more money |
| 38:14 | you see what happens when people get |
| 38:15 | more money there's just more inflation |
| 38:17 | of that hidden tax kicks in so what do |
| 38:19 | we want we want better education better |
| 38:20 | chances for everyone better |
| 38:22 | opportunities I guess it's it's like |
| 38:26 | there's a lot of stuff that everyone |
| 38:27 | kind of agrees on |
| 38:28 | right why do you think we think about |
| 38:31 | luck |
| 38:33 | incorrectly my thing on luck is like |
| 38:36 | we're we're incredibly lucky there's |
| 38:39 | certain things that we devalue right so |
| 38:41 | so um looks is a really good example |
| 38:44 | like if someone's a model and they're |
| 38:46 | they're gorgeous and they're |
| 38:48 | photographed lucky people are kind of a |
| 38:51 | bit dismissive of that if someone's born |
| 38:53 | really smart you never you're lucky you |
| 38:56 | born with an IQ of 162 bit of luck no |
| 38:59 | one thinks that we sort of the two great |
| 39:02 | myths in our society are um uh it's hard |
| 39:07 | work and talent aren't they and it's |
| 39:10 | always total it's always a mix |
| 39:13 | of the two and finding the right medium |
| 39:16 | the right Edge for you the right thing |
| 39:17 | to be doing so you go people think oh |
| 39:20 | you know Bill Gates oh he worked so hard |
| 39:22 | he used to work 18 hours a day slept at |
| 39:24 | the office he worked so hard to build |
| 39:25 | that company he's incredibly bright he |
| 39:28 | had you know it's it's always you know |
| 39:30 | the talent and the hard work you know |
| 39:34 | Michael Jordan if he hadn't shown up to |
| 39:36 | practice would be just a |
| 39:38 | guy um and also if he was living 200 |
| 39:42 | years ago pre- basketball I don't know I |
| 39:46 | don't know you know that skill set is |
| 39:47 | very |
| 39:48 | particular so you what's what's what's |
| 39:52 | what's luck the everyone's incredibly |
| 39:54 | lucky I mean just to be here here is |
| 39:57 | it's beyond |
| 39:58 | right I don't know I kind of I like the |
| 40:01 | idea of just going okay look we're very |
| 40:02 | lucky we've got what we've got run with |
| 40:05 | it and also you're not going to change |
| 40:06 | it you you might that thing of like |
| 40:08 | acceptance being kind of that first step |
| 40:10 | in therapy strikes me as really sensible |
| 40:13 | just looking at what you've got and go |
| 40:14 | right this is it this is it for the |
| 40:16 | whole journey I can work on this it's |
| 40:18 | like nature nurture obviously nature |
| 40:21 | it's got a bigger effect than nurture |
| 40:23 | but nurture is the only bit anyone gives |
| 40:25 | a about cuz the only bit you can |
| 40:26 | play with yeah until I can start |
| 40:28 | fiddling with my DNA sensibly then I'm |
| 40:31 | going to be I'll be nurturing and |
| 40:33 | nurture people seem to think nurture |
| 40:35 | stops you know people seem to think |
| 40:37 | nurture and environment is the thing for |
| 40:39 | kids yeah and the right school but |
| 40:42 | really look at you as a shining example |
| 40:44 | of environment so you you put yourself |
| 40:48 | in the micro and the macro in a better |
| 40:50 | environment than you were in 5 years ago |
| 40:52 | you're not surrounded by people on love |
| 40:53 | Island you're surrounded by these |
| 40:55 | incredible intellect |
| 40:56 | and you've taken yourself out of your |
| 40:59 | where you grew up and went to University |
| 41:01 | and you've taken yourself to to Austin |
| 41:02 | because there's there's kind of energy |
| 41:04 | there and there's other people that are |
| 41:05 | trying to do the same thing as you and |
| 41:06 | you put yourself in that environment |
| 41:07 | that strikes me as as incredibly kind of |
| 41:10 | powerful but the idea that you know if |
| 41:12 | you're still hanging around with the |
| 41:12 | people you hung around with 25 years ago |
| 41:15 | and they're not adding value then what |
| 41:17 | are you doing yeah me and George had |
| 41:19 | this idea that we're going to write a an |
| 41:22 | essay on together so I'm going to try |
| 41:23 | and explain it to you now it's not fully |
| 41:24 | thought out but we'll see if we can get |
| 41:26 | there the difference between observable |
| 41:28 | and hidden metrics and how they |
| 41:31 | influence our motivation so a lot of the |
| 41:35 | time people will trade a hidden metric |
| 41:38 | for an observable metric good example of |
| 41:40 | a hidden metric would be something like |
| 41:42 | peace of |
| 41:43 | mind okay and something like an |
| 41:45 | observable metric would be money people |
| 41:48 | will happily trade something which may |
| 41:50 | be more valuable ultimately for |
| 41:54 | something which is less valuable simply |
| 41:56 | because they can measure it more |
| 41:57 | effectively yeah like time's an |
| 41:59 | interesting one because John lenon lyric |
| 42:01 | isn't it I give you everything I got for |
| 42:03 | a little peace of mind there we go that |
| 42:06 | but that it's a very interesting point |
| 42:07 | because that idea of going you know if |
| 42:09 | you can't measure it we tend to go to |
| 42:11 | what's measured correct and so the idea |
| 42:13 | of going these and but actually what |
| 42:15 | matters is it's you know emotional yeah |
| 42:18 | and there's no dashboard this is why |
| 42:20 | George tries to have a dashboard for all |
| 42:23 | of the things that he does he's got this |
| 42:25 | end of day |
| 42:26 | assessment type form custom type form |
| 42:29 | he's made himself that autop populates |
| 42:31 | to a Google sheet and at the end yeah |
| 42:34 | yeah he's he was born an incel but |
| 42:36 | managed to ascend out of it he has got |
| 42:39 | himself to the stage where he's tracking |
| 42:42 | what were the three things that I did |
| 42:43 | today what was my sense of presence how |
| 42:46 | connected was I D D D D D all the way |
| 42:48 | down and his goal is to track this over |
| 42:50 | time right to see what are the |
| 42:52 | correlations between my actions and the |
| 42:53 | way that I felt so he's trying to make |
| 42:55 | the hidden |
| 42:56 | observable and the problem that we have |
| 42:58 | is that things that really really matter |
| 43:00 | to us like connection and peace of mind |
| 43:03 | and you know dopamine and serotonin |
| 43:05 | balance throughout the day like how |
| 43:07 | content and fulfilled did I feel all of |
| 43:09 | these things they're just words |
| 43:11 | there's this nebulous ephemeral Wishy |
| 43:13 | what it's trying to hold smoke right to |
| 43:15 | try and work out what this is but money |
| 43:19 | my bank account it's good game |
| 43:21 | the number of followers I've got on |
| 43:23 | social media it's a really good |
| 43:24 | game so I'll chase down |
| 43:26 | the observable well it gets back to that |
| 43:29 | story of like what's the most successful |
| 43:31 | story in human history |
| 43:34 | money money is The Greatest Story Ever |
| 43:36 | Told because what even is it really when |
| 43:39 | you break it down it's kind of um it's |
| 43:42 | not anything and yet everyone believes |
| 43:44 | in it everyone believes in that story |
| 43:46 | and what you're getting to is what's |
| 43:48 | really important in life and the stuff |
| 43:50 | that maybe you can't measure is kind of |
| 43:53 | what matters right I wonder if there's |
| 43:57 | the this hidden observable framework |
| 43:58 | that we've got here I wonder if there's |
| 44:00 | an equivalent to do with luck so what |
| 44:02 | you were talking about is that the |
| 44:05 | actual chance of us all being here which |
| 44:08 | I did for my tedex talk I actually |
| 44:10 | looked at this it's the same likelihood |
| 44:12 | as all 7 million people in Ireland |
| 44:15 | rolling a trillion sided dice and all of |
| 44:17 | them coming up with the same number it's |
| 44:19 | astronomical it's way way way way way |
| 44:22 | more than all of the particles in the |
| 44:23 | observable universe because your |
| 44:26 | parents had to meet at that particular |
| 44:28 | ovulation cycle with that particular |
| 44:31 | sperm all the way back forget surviving |
| 44:34 | in all of the rest of it to preh |
| 44:36 | humanity correct all of the way the only |
| 44:37 | way that you're here is with the exact |
| 44:40 | precise combination of each different |
| 44:42 | iteration that goes all the way back up |
| 44:44 | had to be that sperm I find that |
| 44:46 | slightly makes my head hurt you know |
| 44:48 | that thing of Sam Harris was talking |
| 44:49 | about this recently the idea that um |
| 44:51 | maybe there's no free will maybe we have |
| 44:54 | to be having this conversation now |
| 44:55 | because when the Big Bang happened |
| 44:58 | everything rolled out this was ordained |
| 44:59 | of course Robert seol's got a new book |
| 45:02 | coming out called determined you know |
| 45:03 | Robert spolski Harvard's evolutionary |
| 45:05 | biologist he's coming on in month and a |
| 45:09 | bit and his new book is called |
| 45:10 | determined and it's uh like how to find |
| 45:13 | happiness in a life with no free will um |
| 45:15 | so it'll be interesting I think one of |
| 45:16 | the things that Sam failed at doing I'm |
| 45:18 | still like is it some people I speak to |
| 45:21 | talk about like ways that free will kind |
| 45:22 | of does come through and all the rest of |
| 45:23 | it but one of the things that I think |
| 45:26 | has at least not instructed me who has |
| 45:28 | listened to a lot of him in |
| 45:31 | is tactically how do I use the |
| 45:34 | information of a deterministic universe |
| 45:37 | to feel |
| 45:39 | more fulfilled given the fact that both |
| 45:41 | of us are such massive fans of agency |
| 45:43 | and everyone that's listening to this |
| 45:44 | podcast will be as well they want to |
| 45:45 | feel like they they're the architect of |
| 45:47 | their own life right that they are |
| 45:49 | actually able to make some sort of |
| 45:51 | imposition on the world it's very |
| 45:54 | disempowering to find that oh I'm just |
| 45:55 | just Domino number 48 million out of |
| 45:59 | today's |
| 46:02 |  it it doesn't doesn't make me |
| 46:04 | feel very empowered so I want I want |
| 46:06 | someone to come in and tactically tell |
| 46:07 | me if this is the case yeah how should I |
| 46:11 | live it's interesting that thing of like |
| 46:13 | the the time scales kind of comes up and |
| 46:16 | also the idea of like what what are we |
| 46:19 | what's important here you sent out a |
| 46:20 | thing recently about you money yeah |
| 46:22 | which I thought was really interesting |
| 46:25 | the idea of like the meme of you |
| 46:27 | money the idea that you could have |
| 46:29 | enough that you could tell people to |
| 46:30 |  off if that's particularly |
| 46:32 | something that you know you want to tell |
| 46:33 | people to off in my experience you |
| 46:34 | can tell people to off with no |
| 46:35 | money good luck but then there's there's |
| 46:38 |  you Freedom was the next iteration |
| 46:41 | and then you got to you family the |
| 46:43 | idea that actually what really matters |
| 46:45 | is having a unit and and family I would |
| 46:48 | take in a broader sense of friends and |
| 46:50 | family having like a a catery around you |
| 46:54 | your tribe if you will around you that's |
| 46:57 | really very interesting to me of like |
| 46:58 | where you're going to play that game |
| 47:00 | where you have agency uh in the world |
| 47:04 | and the idea of going okay well there's |
| 47:05 | certain players you know Elon Musk has |
| 47:07 | got agency at a ludicrous Global level |
| 47:11 | but you know and the global leaders |
| 47:14 | great but on an individual level we all |
| 47:17 | have agency we can all we can all be you |
| 47:20 | know we can all make a |
| 47:23 | difference yeah I I really wish I really |
| 47:28 | wish I could give the gift of sort of |
| 47:29 | higher agency to a lot of people I think |
| 47:31 | it's such a the lack of I know I think |
| 47:33 | sort of the greatest gift like if you |
| 47:35 | could give your child any gift |
| 47:39 | likeability likeability goes a long way |
| 47:41 | that's Peterson's thing do not let your |
| 47:43 | children do anything that makes you not |
| 47:44 | like them like a likable child I think I |
| 47:47 | was in fear I may need to ask my mom |
| 47:50 | when I fear I was an incredibly |
| 47:51 | unlikable child and I think that that |
| 47:54 | shaped that was probably quite formative |
| 47:56 | in a lot of my experiences with other |
| 47:58 | parents with other kids do you not think |
| 48:01 | that I mean I know a little bit about |
| 48:02 | your childhood and kind of what you went |
| 48:04 | through as an only child and feeling |
| 48:06 | slightly isolated but is that not the |
| 48:09 | thing that untethered you and allowed |
| 48:12 | you to sort of fly through so true so I |
| 48:14 | spoke about this yesterday with Steven |
| 48:16 | Bartlett |
| 48:17 | that there's layers to unpacking the |
| 48:20 | things that you went through and the |
| 48:22 | formative experiences that you've had so |
| 48:24 | the first layer is you know a chip on |
| 48:27 | your shoulder about whatever it is that |
| 48:30 | happened to you so for me you know being |
| 48:32 | bullied in school being ostracized not |
| 48:33 | feeling like I was part of a group then |
| 48:35 | the second layer is alchemizing that |
| 48:38 | into something that you really care |
| 48:40 | about so saying okay the skills that I |
| 48:43 | got and the resilience that I developed |
| 48:46 | from spending so much time on my own |
| 48:49 | I've turned something that was toxic |
| 48:52 | into something which is valuable then |
| 48:54 | the layer after that is is I get to use |
| 48:57 | the chip on my shoulder and the |
| 48:58 | resentment for the people that came |
| 49:00 | before me and that caused this problem |
| 49:02 | as the activation energy to now deploy |
| 49:04 | this skill set okay so there now I'm not |
| 49:07 | only uh not only have I made lead into |
| 49:09 | gold but I've now turned this gold into |
| 49:11 | something that's useful I've formed it |
| 49:12 | into something that I can move forward |
| 49:14 | with but then the final one and this is |
| 49:16 | the really difficult one is to |
| 49:18 | realize that if the people who tormented |
| 49:22 | you are the reason that you've developed |
| 49:24 | the skill sets that you carry about then |
| 49:27 | you can't resent them you should thank |
| 49:28 | them that you genuinely should look |
| 49:31 | back at most of the things that you were |
| 49:35 | ashamed of or guilty about or fearful of |
| 49:39 | in your past and realize that that's the |
| 49:41 | Dark Side of one of the lightest and |
| 49:43 | most proud things that you've got so |
| 49:45 | overall if the challenges that you went |
| 49:47 | through formed a person that you |
| 49:49 | like those bullies in school I should |
| 49:52 | sit down with all of them and say yeah |
| 49:55 | thanks man |
| 49:56 | yeah that's uh it's very interesting to |
| 49:59 | listen to Because when you when you go |
| 50:01 | you know to go through that experience |
| 50:03 | it's it's kind of easy now you're 35 |
| 50:06 | you're a grown man and you're doing |
| 50:07 | great but to sort of think back to you |
| 50:09 | are still that child yeah you're still |
| 50:12 | that lonely kid searching for connection |
| 50:15 | but is that not the whole of the show |
| 50:17 | like every episode I listen to you're |
| 50:19 | sort of there kind of looking for a hug |
| 50:23 | you're sort of you're hold meanor is I |
| 50:26 | want to connect with this person I want |
| 50:27 | to know what they know and I want to |
| 50:29 | have a friendship and it's incredibly |
| 50:32 | healthy it just seems like it's it's a |
| 50:35 | yeah everything that happened absolutely |
| 50:37 | worth it and also H what are you going |
| 50:39 | to do you can forgive them and move on |
| 50:43 | or you can hold |
| 50:44 | resentment but it's it's ultimately |
| 50:46 | that's you know what's what's the |
| 50:47 | important thing we can't measure that |
| 50:49 | metric yeah of what that forgiveness |
| 50:51 | gives you as to what that resentment |
| 50:53 | gives you but I would I'd bet the house |
| 50:56 | on the fact that the forgiveness is |
| 50:59 | lighter and breeds more activity yeah |
| 51:02 | I've been thinking recently about the |
| 51:04 | idea of |
| 51:05 | um we can't know the future and we don't |
| 51:08 | fully know ourselves and we don't fully |
| 51:10 | know the present we don't fully know |
| 51:11 | everybody else so we have to concede |
| 51:14 | that some huge proportion of our |
| 51:17 | worldview is a |
| 51:18 | delusion yeah isn't does someone talk |
| 51:20 | about the three humiliations you ever |
| 51:23 | heard of that no what's that the three |
| 51:24 | humiliations of human so it was |
| 51:26 | cernus we're not the center of the |
| 51:28 | universe and then it was Darwin we're |
| 51:32 | we're descended from animals we're not |
| 51:33 | special oh Jesus all right and then the |
| 51:35 | third one Freud our self-conscious is |
| 51:38 | running the show we don't even know |
| 51:39 | ourselves a |
| 51:42 | hell hell it's like Humanity's |
| 51:45 | really taken a combination one big hit |
| 51:48 | after another yeah those are those are |
| 51:50 | big hits and you go yeah we don't really |
| 51:52 | know ourselves but that's kind of the |
| 51:53 | journey and that's the the whole thing I |
| 51:55 | mean that's why I think not to bring it |
| 51:57 | all back to standup comedy but I do |
| 51:59 | think there's something Magnificent |
| 52:01 | about doing a bit of standup you know |
| 52:03 | going and finding your voice and what |
| 52:05 | you find funny and your sense of humor |
| 52:07 | because everyone's kind of got one right |
| 52:09 | in other news this episode is brought to |
| 52:12 | you by nomatic no literally it's |

| 53:13 | I uh so this delusion thing |
| 53:16 | people people don't fully know |
| 53:18 | themselves or the world around them or |
| 53:20 | what's going to happen or all of the |
| 53:21 | rest of it given the fact that you don't |
| 53:24 | know yourself and you're deluded in some |
| 53:27 | way why not pick a delusion that is |
| 53:30 | useful to you well this is what NLP gets |
| 53:33 | you neural linguistic programming talks |
| 53:34 | a lot about |
| 53:35 | presuppositions because you can't know |
| 53:38 | you don't know it for a fact it's kind |
| 53:39 | of you know all bit of a pseudo science |
| 53:42 | so what's useful rather than think about |
| 53:44 | what's correct what's useful what makes |
| 53:46 | a difference if I believe I can do that |
| 53:49 | I can do that the belief is often the |
| 53:52 | thing that makes the |
| 53:53 | difference um H did I do that bit did I |
| 53:56 | tell you about the uh symbolic truth but |
| 54:00 | literal falsehood |
| 54:02 | framework no this is cool okay |
| 54:05 | so things can be symbolically true but |
| 54:08 | literally false and this is most |
| 54:10 | religious stories so the belief that |
| 54:13 | porcupines can throw their quills right |
| 54:15 | literally untrue porcupine can't throw |
| 54:18 | its quills like it's not a it's |
| 54:20 | not Phil the power tailor right |
| 54:24 | uh good luck America listens without |
| 54:26 | reference Phil Taylor a fat Naka dce |
| 54:29 | player Legendary dce player from from |
| 54:32 | England you say legendary I say fat Naka |
| 54:34 | but you know potato potata yeah you can |
| 54:36 | throw a a sharp thing so they can't do |
| 54:39 | that it's a useful thing to belief yeah |
| 54:42 | because they're bobbed and if they get |
| 54:43 | in you you're so not good the |
| 54:46 | belief that porcupines can throw their |
| 54:47 | quills is symbolically true in that it's |
| 54:49 | adaptive for you to believe it another |
| 54:51 | one would be that pigs are uniquely |
| 54:53 | dirty animals ever seen a c cow's pretty |
| 54:55 | dirty as well so all of the religious |
| 54:57 | Traditions that said we don't eat pigs |
| 54:59 | because pigs are uniquely dirty animals |
| 55:02 | literally false figuratively pigs do |
| 55:05 | carry a higher pathogen load typically |
| 55:09 | than other animals in their meat so by |
| 55:11 | believing that that's the case it's an |
| 55:13 | Adaptive uh outcome for you now I |
| 55:16 | learned this from Brett Weinstein six or |
| 55:18 | seven years ago right then I've been |
| 55:21 | playing with it for ages and ages to try |
| 55:23 | and think of something which is |
| 55:25 | literally true but figuratively false so |
| 55:28 | what's the opposite of this right so I |
| 55:30 | was trying to think about something |
| 55:32 | which is might be accurate to know but |
| 55:40 | unadapted Universe even if that is |
| 55:44 | literally what is true figuratively it's |
| 55:47 | an information Hazard I don't think that |
| 55:49 | it really unless you go full like Sam |
| 55:52 | Harris Enlightenment mode and get out |
| 55:54 | the other side side to no one is the |
| 55:55 | architect of their own decisions |
| 55:57 | therefore empathy and forgiveness are |
| 55:58 | much easier to come by which I don't |
| 56:00 | think like practically is is that easy |
| 56:02 | for most people to |
| 56:03 | do I I don't think that that the same as |
| 56:05 | the behavioral genetics red pill if you |
| 56:08 | believe that almost more than 50% of |
| 56:11 | what you are psychologically is locked |
| 56:14 | in and you only get to play with this |
| 56:17 | tiny little sort of cake dressing on the |
| 56:19 | top of it how many cherries do I want to |
| 56:20 | put on top of this cake yeah it doesn't |
| 56:23 | feel it's not very support |
| 56:26 | in terms of how you show up in the world |
| 56:28 | even if it's true so that's something |
| 56:30 | that might be literally true but |
| 56:31 | figuratively false and the porcupine |
| 56:33 | throwing NE qus certainly think it's a |
| 56:34 | very interesting area to sort of talk |
| 56:35 | about because it's about belief makes |
| 56:38 | such a huge difference if you believe in |
| 56:40 | something you can kind of you don't it |
| 56:42 | gives you kind of the will to do it to |
| 56:44 | give it a |
| 56:45 | go about what you think is possible what |
| 56:48 | are your dreams going to be I mean when |
| 56:49 | you started this podcast presumably you |
| 56:51 | didn't think I'll be Austin Texas |
| 56:54 | talking to the Great and the good and |
| 56:56 | trying to figure things out yeah it's |
| 56:58 | like that's why I think the book thing |
| 56:59 | is really interesting for you now of |
| 57:00 | like trying to rather than just uh at |
| 57:04 | the level of okay trying to figure this |
| 57:05 | thing out and it's kind of interesting |
| 57:06 | to chat about it's like putting down |
| 57:08 | these thoughts and going you know does |
| 57:10 | it does it grow corn what what are the |
| 57:12 | bits of wisdom that are most affected |
| 57:14 | how you live |
| 57:15 | daytoday it's why I think that the next |
| 57:17 | 24 hours is really interesting yeah of |
| 57:19 | like what could you do that adds value |
| 57:21 | to you tomorrow such a lovely frame such |
| 57:24 | lovely FR you you talk about uh |
| 57:27 | disposition being more important than |
| 57:29 | position yeah what you mean by that well |
| 57:32 | listen I know some billionaires that are |
| 57:33 | pretty miserable and I know some guys |
| 57:35 | with uh boring office jobs that are very |
| 57:37 | happy I think your disposition is it's |
| 57:41 | very difficult to change but it's often |
| 57:43 | easier than changing the world you know |
| 57:46 | you are you're in your head on your own |
| 57:48 | an awful lot of the time no matter how |
| 57:50 | connected you are no matter how great |
| 57:51 | your family you're you you are you and |
| 57:54 | you know the acceptance of that |
| 57:56 | and the way that you see the world the |
| 57:59 | rose tinted glasses of looking at the |
| 58:00 | world looking for jokes is pretty |
| 58:02 | tremendous I think the thing that makes |
| 58:04 | a difference to people on disposition is |
| 58:08 | um in the most part it's gratitude can |
| 58:12 | kind of move the dial that's the thing |
| 58:14 | that seems to make a difference because |
| 58:15 | it's that thing of like if you're if |
| 58:17 | you're in a bad mood all the time you're |
| 58:20 | not in a bad mood you're an |
| 58:21 |  it's the truth of it so it's go |
| 58:24 | you how are you most of the time the how |
| 58:26 | you treat a waiter or a waitress or how |
| 58:28 | you react when you get a speeding ticket |
| 58:30 | or any of those little things that CU |
| 58:32 | life is going to throw lots of that |
| 58:33 | stuff at you how do you react to it h |
| 58:35 | how how are you in the world what's your |
| 58:38 | is it a sunny disposition or are you |
| 58:39 | kind of you know are you are you are you |
| 58:42 | boring well you've been through bouts of |
| 58:45 | depression as as I have I I actually |
| 58:47 | thought throughout all of my 20s that I |
| 58:49 | was depressed I thought that that was |
| 58:50 | the texture of my mind I thought it was |
| 58:51 | locked in like the worst weed trip that |
| 58:54 | you've ever had this is me for the rest |
| 58:55 | of my life okay so I'm interested in |
| 58:57 | conflated words and I often think |
| 58:59 | depression is conflated with sadness and |
| 59:02 | sadness is much more um difficult to |
| 59:05 | admit and it's much more uh there's more |
| 59:08 | of a stigma around being I'm depressed |
| 59:10 | it's kind of there's a c certain glamour |
| 59:12 | to being depressed Loof it's sort of |
| 59:14 | this mysterious thing it's pathologized |
| 59:16 | it suggests depth yeah where sadness is |
| 59:19 | just all you sad you're sad what do |
| 59:22 | you do you got a surface level life |
| 59:25 | you run clubs I'm sure you're having a |
| 59:27 | nice time whatever but it's it's surface |
| 59:30 | level so that Depression was maybe |
| 59:32 | sadness but I think if it's |
| 59:33 | environmental if you could change it if |
| 59:35 | it's not to do with the serotonin levels |
| 59:37 | in your head and a cical embance then |
| 59:40 | it's if you can do something about it |
| 59:41 | it's sadness so assuming it's sadness |
| 59:44 | and that you can do something about it I |
| 59:46 | me listen it's people with real mental |
| 59:47 | health problems and my heart goes out to |
| 59:49 | them but for a lot of people it's just |
| 59:51 | their it's circumstantial but you went |
| 59:53 | through periods of acute sadness or |
| 59:56 | depression however you want |
| 59:58 | to label it and yet you've managed to |
| 60:01 | get yourself to a stage largely |
| 60:04 | anxieties being the big is really my um |
| 60:08 | drug of choice yeah and anxiety I |
| 60:11 | think's got I think there's a gift in |
| 60:12 | there I think the gratitude that I have |
| 60:13 | for anxiety is it's the flip side of |
| 60:15 | creativity correct that your mind is |
| 60:17 | racing and sometimes you're trying to |
| 60:19 | solve a problem in the future because |
| 60:22 | you don't have anything to do now it's |
| 60:23 | why people talk about you know I'm so |
| 60:25 | happy when I exercise because you're |
| 60:27 | giving yourself a problem right now and |
| 60:30 | your mind is dealing with whatever |
| 60:31 | lifting that up and putting it down yeah |
| 60:32 | you put 120 kilos on a on a bar you're |
| 60:35 | not thinking about much else other than |
| 60:36 | I really need to get this off me yeah |
| 60:39 | that that thing of like that simple |
| 60:41 | thing of going you probably don't have |
| 60:42 | enough to do if you're anxious about |
| 60:46 | silly things in the future or the um I |
| 60:48 | mean I'm I'm I get very tied up |
| 60:51 | with counterfactuals and wondering about |
| 60:54 | about what might have been and what |
| 60:55 | should I have |
| 60:57 | done and you know it kind of links to me |
| 61:01 | to that weird thing of like no one's |
| 61:02 | scared of falling off a cliff worried |
| 61:05 | about |
| 61:06 | jumping there's a there's there's kind |
| 61:08 | of a weird thing of going what have i' |
| 61:10 | done something different what if i' I |
| 61:12 | could told you that that you've heard |
| 61:13 | that Douglas Murray thing about in life |
| 61:15 | we must choose our regrets right yeah I |
| 61:18 | mean you can have anything you can't |
| 61:20 | have everything |
| 61:22 | yeah yeah that uh what could have been |
| 61:25 | we can't split test life we can't go |
| 61:27 | back yeah and give this another crack I |
| 61:29 | tell you for a guy with a sunny |
| 61:30 | disposition it's a very serious |
| 61:31 | conversation isn't it yeah I quite like |
| 61:33 | this I feel this is very I feel like in |
| 61:35 | the moment to Calla it feels very |
| 61:38 | revealing to have this conversation |
| 61:40 | because it doesn't feel unlike the |
| 61:41 | conversation we had at dinner the other |
| 61:42 | day but it is that thing if you go it's |
| 61:44 | kind of showing more of yourself than |
| 61:45 | you you know normally it's just dick |
| 61:48 | Jokes wait until people see you haven't |
| 61:49 | got pants on |
| 61:51 | underneath uh cut to the white yeah |
| 61:56 | it needs to be very wide um yeah I so |
| 61:59 | I'm interested in |
| 62:02 | this if anxiety is your malady your |
| 62:05 | mental malady of choice yeah and yet |
| 62:07 | you've managed to get yourself to |
| 62:09 | a state where you are in a sunny |
| 62:12 | disposition at least some nonzero amount |
| 62:14 | of the time well yeah sorry just to go |
| 62:17 | back to because I'm still thinking about |
| 62:18 | disposition position because people |
| 62:21 | climb to a position and they think |
| 62:23 | happiness is going live there and I |
| 62:26 | think you'd be better served trying to |
| 62:27 | make yourself happy and then worrying |
| 62:29 | about where you're |
| 62:31 | going I think your happiness your |
| 62:33 | emotional well-being working on that |
| 62:36 | first seems to be a very sensible thing |
| 62:39 | because it doesn't live down the road it |
| 62:42 | doesn't live you know you put a million |
| 62:44 | dollars in the bank it won't it won't |
| 62:46 | make you less |
| 62:48 | insecure that kind of scarcity mindset |
| 62:51 | is kind of poison is that a lesson that |
| 62:54 | can be learned without going and seeing |
| 62:56 | the top of the mountain yourself because |
| 62:58 | there will be a lot of people that could |
| 63:00 | say Jimmy easy for you to say about Fame |
| 63:03 | isn't going to fix your problems money |
| 63:05 | isn't going to fix your problems you've |
| 63:06 | achieved both well fame fame I think has |
| 63:09 | replaced heaven in a secular |
| 63:13 | World Fame is the land of milk and honey |
| 63:15 | where everything is okay and you're |
| 63:17 | looked after and it's perfect and I'm |
| 63:20 | not knocking it I love being famous but |
| 63:23 | it's not the be all and end all and |
| 63:25 | actually again you can you can kind of |
| 63:27 | split test that cuz I can go to a |
| 63:29 | country where I'm not known not many but |
| 63:32 | there's a |
| 63:33 | few you talk about why trajectory is so |
| 63:37 | important as well and I think that this |
| 63:39 | ties in here it's all people see isn't |
| 63:41 | it like people aren't interested in how |
| 63:44 | you know if you're playing 250 shows a |
| 63:46 | year like I've been doing that for years |
| 63:48 | it's not exciting it's not news it's |
| 63:50 | news when people arrive and they're new |
| 63:52 | so when something you know |
| 63:54 | in I think film and TV and comedy and |
| 63:57 | kind of entertainment it's it's like |
| 64:00 | it's all about where were they last year |
| 64:02 | where they this year just |
| 64:04 | maintaining no one seems to care |
| 64:06 | although Comics aren't entertainers in |
| 64:08 | the true sense the true definition of an |
| 64:11 | Entertainer is if you don't like me I |
| 64:14 | don't like |
| 64:16 | me oh that's interesting you've a real |
| 64:19 | Entertainer you've outsourced your |
| 64:20 | selfworth to the crowd of course that's |
| 64:22 | what an Entertainer is and there's I |
| 64:24 | know guys that are entertaining some |
| 64:25 | friend said that to me and it was like |
| 64:27 | oh man that is that is your journey good |
| 64:30 | luck that's hard comedians desperately |
| 64:32 | want to be loved but entirely on their |
| 64:33 | own terms it's a lovely Paradox do you |
| 64:36 | see that in yourself what what's the the |
| 64:39 | lesson here |
| 64:41 | between the desire to make people happy |
| 64:44 | and laugh and being this uh how do you |
| 64:48 | say like intrinsic drug dealer yeah and |
| 64:53 | the fact that you need to be able |
| 64:56 | to go home at night and put your head on |
| 64:59 | the pillow without having you know if if |
| 65:03 | your selfworth is inflated by the crowd |
| 65:06 | then it can be deflated by their |
| 65:08 | criticism yeah I mean listen that's the |
| 65:11 | if if something if something out there |
| 65:12 | makes you happy losing it is going to |
| 65:14 | make you sad so it it matters I think |
| 65:17 | putting on a good show though is about |
| 65:19 | going do I think it's funny you know |
| 65:21 | there's certain things that I write and |
| 65:22 | I go ah feels a bit |
| 65:24 | doesn't feel quite hasn't got a great |
| 65:28 | structure to it it's not quite the right |
| 65:29 | sort of joke for me I'm going to leave |
| 65:31 | it it's it's not great and then there's |
| 65:34 | stuff that I like more than the crowd |
| 65:37 | and it's finding a balance where you go |
| 65:39 | look I know what you paid to see I know |
| 65:42 | why you're here and you know the world |
| 65:44 | ordered a stand-up comedian and I'm |
| 65:46 | going to honor that I'm going to be as |
| 65:48 | good at this as I can be and you know |
| 65:51 | it's kind of a mediation but it's very |
| 65:53 | much on my terms in ter these are the |
| 65:55 | jokes that I tell we spoke about that |
| 65:57 | trajectory thing of a dinner and it's |
| 65:59 | really interesting |
| 66:01 | because Andrew Tate someone you might |
| 66:03 | not have |
| 66:04 | thought wisdom from this area of the |
| 66:07 | world would have would have applied but |
| 66:08 | he says having things isn't fun getting |
| 66:11 | things is fun and well a stopped a |
| 66:15 | stopped clock is right twice a |
| 66:18 | day Ian he says a lot of things he's |
| 66:20 | bound to get some stuff right he's kind |
| 66:21 | of an interesting cultural phenomenon |
| 66:23 | because I think the what do you think |
| 66:24 | happened with with Tate have you done a |
| 66:26 | postmortem on his ascendancy to no I |
| 66:29 | mean the only thing I would say is that |
| 66:31 | you know young men I feel are in crisis |
| 66:35 | and uh not that young women aren't in |
| 66:38 | crisis they are as well I mean young |
| 66:40 | people generally but it feels like young |
| 66:42 | men are having a a silent crisis you |
| 66:46 | know we we talk about certain things and |
| 66:47 | we don't talk about um other things and |
| 66:50 | you know young men committing suicide |
| 66:52 | seems to be a it's a huge problem at the |
| 66:55 | moment and a lack of purpose and agency |
| 66:58 | is a huge you know why video games so |
| 67:00 | popular you know especially with young |
| 67:02 | men and it's a um a fact simile of |
| 67:06 | career and purpose and drive and |
| 67:10 | different levels and there's something |
| 67:11 | in us there not that men and women are |
| 67:13 | so very different I always think like |
| 67:15 | the big difference gender-wise |
| 67:17 | is men are all taking a |
| 67:20 | performance-enhancing drug every single |
| 67:23 | day and that drug is testosterone and |
| 67:26 | really if you had to talk about what |
| 67:27 | testosterone does for men it's |
| 67:29 | risk-taking so and we talk a lot about |
| 67:32 | all the CEOs all the big CEOs are men |
| 67:34 | and it's very unfair but also prisons |
| 67:36 | are full of men because men take |
| 67:38 | ludicrous risks so I think if you were |
| 67:40 | going to life hack for I mean I've got a |
| 67:43 | daughter and the advice I I'll give her |
| 67:45 | is take more |
| 67:46 | risks and you can because you're making |
| 67:49 | it a conscious decision it's not a |
| 67:50 | hormonal decision then maybe you can |
| 67:53 | actually do better better because you |
| 67:55 | can not do the dumb you don't need |
| 67:56 | to jump from the high board but you can |
| 68:00 | move to a city where there's more |
| 68:02 | opportunities taking those risks that |
| 68:06 | that you know the average man |
| 68:09 | takes like I kind of look back and it |
| 68:11 | seemed so easy that I left my |
| 68:14 | job and became a |
| 68:16 | comic because I did it the idea that |
| 68:20 | that was pre-ordained so |
| 68:24 | stupid such a ludicrous mid-20s Hail |
| 68:28 | Mary catch of a ah this life's boring |
| 68:31 | I'm going to go and do something more |
| 68:32 | fun crazy um so I think that's it's kind |
| 68:35 | of that's kind of an interesting point |
| 68:36 | of going the um how do we how do we make |
| 68:40 | things more equal between men and women |
| 68:42 | in our society and I think encouraging |
| 68:44 | greater risk in young women is is a |
| 68:47 | really |
| 68:49 | sensible hack cuz that's what that's |
| 68:51 | what guys have got they're taking crazy |
| 68:53 | chances |
| 68:54 | you you you leaving you had a very |
| 68:57 | comfortable life and a good living and a |
| 68:59 | good career and you traded it in for |
| 69:02 | madness for like oh well I'm just going |
| 69:04 | to be you know is autod dictat you know |
| 69:08 | it's like you're self-educated you seem |
| 69:10 | to be you have this kind of thirst for |
| 69:12 | knowledge you're going yeah well maybe |
| 69:14 | I'll just do that just doing the thing |
| 69:16 | that you loved it's one of the reasons |
| 69:18 | why I had such a problem with the term |
| 69:22 | it was meant to be so the reason that I |
| 69:25 | hate |
| 69:26 | this post Hawk |
| 69:29 | rationalization of how a bad situation |
| 69:32 | became a good situation because it was |
| 69:34 | meant to be in the |
| 69:37 | end it completely removes all of the |
| 69:39 | agency that you had overturning that |
| 69:41 |  situation into something that was |
| 69:43 | good let's say that you lose a leg in a |
| 69:46 | car crash and you're in a hospital bed |
| 69:48 | and while you're there you begin |
| 69:50 | watching history YouTube videos |
| 69:54 | about ancient Rome and you realize that |
| 69:58 | you're really interested in it and 10 |
| 70:00 | years later you are now the biggest |
| 70:03 | ancient Rome historian presenting shows |
| 70:06 | for your own channel maybe you're on the |
| 70:08 | BBC you've written books your best you |
| 70:09 | got only got one leg but it doesn't |
| 70:11 | matter saying it was meant to be I got |
| 70:15 | in that car crash for a reason so that I |
| 70:18 | would spend enough time in a hospital |
| 70:19 | bed so that I would find the videos |
| 70:21 | about the Roman Empire so that I could |
| 70:23 | have this |
| 70:25 | career ultimately Nets out at taking |
| 70:27 | away all of the alchemy that you had |
| 70:31 | yeah that turned this hang on let's do |
| 70:33 | it in a reverse way you had you got |
| 70:35 | dealt a really unfortunate card and |
| 70:39 | managed to there we go that's Blackjack |
| 70:42 | but the the cards you got dealt are the |
| 70:44 | cards you got dealt I really like that |
| 70:46 | thing of like at some point you got to |
| 70:48 | go with what you got or you're not going |
| 70:50 | to go so you just you do what you need |
| 70:52 | to do and like it's interesting now the |
| 70:55 | uh like the the educational bit of this |
| 70:57 | the idea that you're going look it's |
| 71:00 | it's |
| 71:01 | uh you're educating yourself now to what |
| 71:05 | end to what purpose well you're making |
| 71:06 | it easier for for other people down the |
| 71:08 | line and I'm working on a thing at the |
| 71:10 | moment where I'm trying to write a um a |
| 71:13 | language for comedy I'm trying to write |
| 71:15 | I'm excited for this trying to write a |
| 71:17 | comedy course a book I'm not quite sure |
| 71:19 | what it's going to be but the idea of |
| 71:21 | going I think there's too much Mis ISM |
| 71:24 | about writing jokes I think even |
| 71:26 | professionals even some of the goats uh |
| 71:29 | they kind of write it on stage and they |
| 71:31 | embody a um a part of their Persona on |
| 71:34 | stage and they can conjure up these |
| 71:37 | funny things and there's |
| 71:38 | Alchemy yeah maybe but actually you can |
| 71:41 | break it down you can break down what |
| 71:43 | you're doing there and and it can be |
| 71:45 | taught the idea that it can't be taught |
| 71:48 | is to me so incredibly limiting the idea |
| 71:52 | that comedy can't be taught is like it's |
| 71:53 | like going well music can't be taught of |
| 71:55 | course because great musici he saying |
| 71:57 | that the comedy industry has an |
| 71:58 | disproportionate number of narcissists |
| 72:00 | in it Jimmy that would be a surprise how |
| 72:02 | dare you um yeah I I've got a good line |
| 72:05 | on narcissism I think I've got a couple |
| 72:07 | of narcissists in my life so my line is |
| 72:09 | a narcissist they've got the disease and |
| 72:11 | you've got the |
| 72:14 | symptoms pretty much sort of sums it up |
| 72:17 | doesn't |
| 72:17 | it hey it's it's an issue if you got one |
| 72:20 | in your life you know about it um yeah I |
| 72:22 | think it's really in that thing of going |
| 72:24 | if it was like music more like music and |
| 72:27 | people could sort of discover themselves |
| 72:29 | because really what are the teenage |
| 72:30 | years about you it's uncomfortable being |
| 72:33 | a teenager it's uncomfortable like and |
| 72:35 | and the and we're all you know growing |
| 72:37 | it doesn't really stop but that idea of |
| 72:40 | going well who am I if you're the person |
| 72:42 | you were 10 years ago then you up |
| 72:44 | if there's no growth in it if you |
| 72:46 | haven't progressed but it's constantly |
| 72:49 | asking yourselves kind of the right |
| 72:50 | questions and and and finding a bit of |
| 72:53 | humor in that is just makes it just |
| 72:55 | makes the the journey a little bit |
| 72:57 | easier doesn't it talking about that |
| 73:00 | trajectory and |
| 73:03 | how it's important to think about where |
| 73:05 | you're going and other people respond to |
| 73:08 | the rising or falling of your stock in |
| 73:10 | kind there's an aru but that's that's |
| 73:13 | character versus reputation so character |
| 73:15 | is what you know about yourself if you |
| 73:18 | have a crisis and you're getting |
| 73:19 | cancelled um your reputation is in the |
| 73:22 | toilet m but you still know who you are |
| 73:26 | you know you still you know who you are |
| 73:27 | and it's that the fundamental question |
| 73:29 | when you're in the middle of a |
| 73:30 | cancellation crisis is who are |
| 73:34 | you oh my Jimmy I'm a standup comedian I |
| 73:36 | tell edgy jokes oh |
| 73:39 | okay that's fine this seems appropriate |
| 73:42 | there's no problem you know who you are |
| 73:43 | you know what you're about it's it's uh |
| 73:46 | it's ultimately it's about that kind of |
| 73:48 | thing just going okay this is this is |
| 73:49 | fine and also where's your where does |
| 73:52 | your happiness lie |
| 73:54 | if it's outside of you if in that true |
| 73:56 | Entertainer self if you don't love me |
| 73:58 | then I don't love |
| 74:00 | me what's it feel like to be canceled or |
| 74:03 | attempted canceled um it's interesting |
| 74:05 | like what the term means now I don't |
| 74:07 | think it's um you call it cancellation I |
| 74:10 | call it free publicity it's it hasn't |
| 74:13 | really had I don't know whether it |
| 74:15 | really exists uh I think it does I think |
| 74:17 | like there's extreme cases where people |
| 74:19 | are can no longer work and um are |
| 74:23 | shunned but hasn't there always been |
| 74:27 | cancellation it's kind of a new new word |
| 74:29 | for something that we've always had |
| 74:30 | there were always people that were um |
| 74:33 | you know but you've said something |
| 74:35 | unsayable I mean you've got a right size |
| 74:37 | it as well the things I've been |
| 74:39 | cancelled for I told a joke and some |
| 74:41 | people didn't like |
| 74:42 | it we got to right size that that's |
| 74:44 | that's not that bad uh I got cancel once |
| 74:47 | over tax avoidance not tax evasion you |
| 74:51 | know the difference no it's about 18 |
| 74:52 | months in prison |
| 74:55 | but you know that thing of going you |
| 74:59 | you that was very easy because if you |
| 75:02 | get cancelled for tax evasion and you |
| 75:05 | say well I'm I'm going to pay the money |
| 75:07 | back great we cannot forgive what we |
| 75:10 | cannot punish there's certain things |
| 75:13 | that religion does better than a secular |
| 75:15 | society where we cannot forgive what we |
| 75:18 | cannot punish so certain crimes like no |
| 75:20 | laws been broken but ah that guy now |
| 75:23 | gives me the |
| 75:25 | ick okay well should he never be allowed |
| 75:27 | to work again is what did he do what did |
| 75:30 | he do are there criminal charges what's |
| 75:31 | going on here what's what's actually |
| 75:34 | happening and the the reputational |
| 75:38 | damage and what what could be done |
| 75:39 | online in a day I mean you can tear |
| 75:41 | something down pretty |
| 75:44 | quick and it's uh it it happens every |
| 75:47 | week it happens to regular people it's |
| 75:50 | there's a lack of um I suppose because |
| 75:52 | we live on online and we're not seeing |
| 75:54 | the whites of each other's eyes um |
| 75:57 | kindness compassion |
| 75:59 | forgiveness and very dehumanizing |
| 76:01 | especially when you get to a certain |
| 76:02 | level of of |
| 76:05 | Fame people no longer see very famous |
| 76:08 | people as people they see them as a |
| 76:11 | representation of an ideology they're a |
| 76:15 | conglomeration of ideas sat behind an at |
| 76:18 | symbol on some form of social media |
| 76:21 | which is why they're prepared to say |
| 76:22 | completely reprehensible things that |
| 76:25 | they wouldn't say to someone who is much |
| 76:26 | smaller but they would even say much |
| 76:28 | more reprehensible things to the person |
| 76:29 | that's much smaller on social media than |
| 76:31 | they would say to them face to face or |
| 76:32 | they would even say to them |
| 76:33 | written a weird thing as well with the |
| 76:35 | cancellation work the Press would have |
| 76:37 | you believe press opinion public opinion |
| 76:40 | and Twitter X are the same thing and |
| 76:43 | they're all very |
| 76:46 | different well they want to be the |
| 76:49 | Arbiters The Gatekeepers of true public |
| 76:52 | opinion they're not the news aren't in |
| 76:54 | the news business they're in the |
| 76:55 | clickbait business clickbait is their |
| 76:59 | product yeah it's I wonder what news |
| 77:03 | looks like without that I mean it's you |
| 77:05 | what was your idea you wanted news |
| 77:07 | without the without this the video the |
| 77:10 | sound yeah news without news without |
| 77:12 | opinion would be I think very |
| 77:14 | interesting uh there's a there's a um |
| 77:17 | website at the moment like an app called |
| 77:19 | the knowledge which gives you all the |
| 77:21 | day's news and it comes out of about |
| 77:23 | noon great not first thing have a cup of |
| 77:26 | tea and relax first but it's like five |
| 77:28 | sentences tells you all the news you |
| 77:30 | need to know for the day kind of great |
| 77:33 | it was an interesting idea of well do |
| 77:35 | you need all the commentary do you need |
| 77:37 | to know what they think about |
| 77:40 | it it's like it's a weird thing there's |
| 77:43 | a great book called uh by Neil Postman |
| 77:45 | called amusing ourselves to death and it |
| 77:48 | came out in 1984 and it's him kind of |
| 77:50 | railing against they put music music on |
| 77:53 | the news M it's a show now this that's |
| 77:58 | that's the beginning of the end for him |
| 77:59 | they put music on the news and you go |
| 78:02 | yeah this is It's Entertainment I really |
| 78:05 | enjoyed that um what's our problem book |
| 78:07 | by Tim Urban yes I thought was |
| 78:10 | absolutely fantastic just the idea of |
| 78:11 | going you know you kind of follow |
| 78:13 | politics like you're following a a team |
| 78:16 | you know people are they're just they're |
| 78:18 | one or the other and they're following |
| 78:19 | and they're not really watching politics |
| 78:21 | they're watching the real politicians of |
| 78:23 | Washington DC where they've picked seven |
| 78:25 | Great characters to follow yeah like |
| 78:27 | real housewives you know reality is |
| 78:29 | boring reality TV is great well the news |
| 78:31 | is the same it's a great book I really I |
| 78:34 | would I think that's the book that's |
| 78:35 | changed the way I think about things |
| 78:37 | more than anything else the last sort of |
| 78:39 | 12 months really great book you wish |
| 78:42 | you'd read that 10 years ago before you |
| 78:44 | went through a bunch of I wish I'd read |
| 78:46 | it when I was at College I think that's |
| 78:48 | it's a weird thing where um you know the |
| 78:51 | stuff I was reading at College was was |
| 78:53 | sort of nonsense this episode is brought |
| 78:55 | to you by eight sleep we have decided to |
| 78:58 | land in the UK during a heat wave and |

| 79:03 | could escape the heat turns out I |
| 79:05 | haven't and the Pod cover from eight |
| 79:06 | sleep would have been a lifesaver the |

| 79:54 | sleep.com |
| 79:55 | slod wisdom but yeah go back you know |
| 79:59 | regardless of character and reputation |
| 80:01 | and how much you've tried to bate the |
| 80:03 | two and Silo them off from each |
| 80:05 | other there must be a felt sense of fear |
| 80:08 | there must be a felt sense of ah like |
| 80:10 | this is happening and largely I'm being |
| 80:12 | I'm being no it's the worst breakup |
| 80:14 | you've ever being canceled is the worst |
| 80:15 | breakup you've ever had because you |
| 80:18 | you're losing the person you love the |
| 80:19 | most you're losing you because you've |
| 80:22 | created and this Cur created and curated |
| 80:28 | this person this this thing and you have |
| 80:31 | a reputation which is your your brand is |
| 80:34 | um sort of a a decentralized opinion on |
| 80:38 | who you are living in other people's |
| 80:39 | heads and in a day it's gone or changed |
| 80:44 | or you know ruined but it's you know |
| 80:46 | it's all right I think it makes you more |
| 80:48 | the good to take from it is the empathy |
| 80:50 | it gives you I always call on the day |
| 80:53 | what do you think people who aren't |
| 80:55 | famous don't know about |
| 80:58 | fame |
| 80:59 | um I I don't know I mean I I sort of |
| 81:02 | Stand by that idea it's the land of milk |
| 81:04 | and honey it's kind of uh a secular |
| 81:06 | Heaven it's it's kind of my view as it's |
| 81:09 | the natural state to be because we're |
| 81:11 | meant to live in tribes right for the |
| 81:13 | longest time we lived in tribes and |
| 81:14 | let's say there was 60 80 people in the |
| 81:16 | tribe and everyone knew everyone and |
| 81:18 | meeting a stranger was weird what being |
| 81:20 | famous is like is it's like you live in |
| 81:23 | one of those tribes but you've got |
| 81:24 | Alzheimer's so I don't know anyone but |
| 81:27 | they all know me so people come out it |
| 81:29 | makes the world a very friendly place so |
| 81:31 | I go into a coffee shop and get a coffee |
| 81:33 | and people go you're the guy from the |
| 81:35 | thing and you immediate there's no small |
| 81:36 | talk you're into talking about your |
| 81:37 | career and your life and what's going on |
| 81:38 | with them and you have a connection with |
| 81:41 | people and sometimes people don't like |
| 81:43 | you and those people ignore you and that |
| 81:46 | it's just a regular |
| 81:48 | stranger it's great people don't bother |
| 81:51 | having a negative interaction with you |
| 81:53 | so they just come up and say something |
| 81:54 | nice if they're going to something nice |
| 81:55 | or they don't say anything Al it's like |
| 81:57 | a selection effect the only people that |
| 81:58 | do bother coming up to you are the |
| 82:00 | people that like you the people that |
| 82:01 | don't like you just ignore you yeah or |
| 82:03 | they just don't know who the hell I am |
| 82:05 | you know I think be I I came up I'm one |
| 82:07 | of the last guys I think to come up and |
| 82:09 | be famous in in certainly in the UK in |
| 82:11 | that sense of you know mass |
| 82:13 | media I'm T |
| 82:16 | famous and now I think increasingly |
| 82:18 | we're going to have people that are |
| 82:19 | famous but in a very limited |
| 82:21 | way |
| 82:23 | so you think about musicians there's |
| 82:25 | very few musicians now that your mom's |
| 82:27 | heard of right if if your moms heard of |
| 82:31 | them they are massive right same amount |
| 82:34 | of records were sold in the 1980s as |
| 82:36 | today but by it used to be sold by 500 |
| 82:39 | artists now sold by 10 same things |
| 82:41 | happen with books used to be 500 authors |
| 82:44 | brought out novels they all do pretty |
| 82:45 | well now it's like four a year and they |
| 82:47 | sell incredible numbers but music and |
| 82:50 | books and if you're into something now |
| 82:52 | it's seems like it's marrow casting so |
| 82:56 | it's interesting like the other night we |
| 82:57 | went out for a drink someone came up and |
| 82:58 | said oh hey how are you someone came up |
| 83:01 | to you and was so into it it's like oh |
| 83:03 | this is my guy this is my guy but it's |
| 83:06 | probably fewer but much more |
| 83:09 | intense yeah it's interesting it's it's |
| 83:12 | just I know we're often told about the |
| 83:15 | Perils of Fame right that it's reality |
| 83:19 | warping and that you privacy gets lost |
| 83:21 | and all the rest of but there's a great |
| 83:23 | line I remember watching Breaking Bad |
| 83:26 | and uh my my girl said uh he talking |
| 83:30 | about it and going well you know power |
| 83:32 | he power um |
| 83:35 | corrupts and she went no power |
| 83:38 | reveals it's like reveals who you really |
| 83:40 | are like the more it it it is kind of a |
| 83:44 | revealing thing I think how so I think |
| 83:46 | you you become you're allowed to be you |
| 83:50 | know do you live in someone else's world |
| 83:51 | or do they live in yours |
| 83:53 | it kind of gets to that you know did we |
| 83:55 | cover that charm |
| 83:57 | Charisma thing I've got a real sort of |
| 83:59 | thing on charm and Charisma being very |
| 84:00 | different and they're they're conflated |
| 84:02 | words they sort of mean the same thing |
| 84:03 | in conversation but I think they're very |
| 84:06 | different I think um charm |
| 84:09 | isn't someone you like it's someone you |
| 84:12 | think would like |
| 84:16 | you Charisma is you come to me charm is |
| 84:21 | I come to you |
| 84:23 | Obama incredibly Charming look at his |
| 84:25 | speech patterns look at the way he HS |
| 84:27 | himself he's like he's mediating the |
| 84:30 | situation it's so damn Charming uh Trump |
| 84:33 | is charismatic you come to me um one |
| 84:37 | isn't better than the other particularly |
| 84:38 | I mean there's a you know example |
| 84:40 | there's one that I prefer there but as |
| 84:41 | an individual uh Jennifer Aniston is |
| 84:44 | charming Angelina Jolie is charismatic |
| 84:48 | now you both get to Brad Pit that's |
| 84:51 | the good news but it's a very different |
| 84:53 | skill set and I think knowing yourself |
| 84:56 | knowing which one you are is very |
| 84:59 | valuable which do you think you are all |
| 85:01 | Charisma zero |
| 85:03 | charm like zero |
| 85:06 | charm of course but that's f it sounds |
| 85:10 | very arrogant I'm all Charisma but you |
| 85:13 | but that's what I'm working with that's |
| 85:15 | the thing of like like so someone |
| 85:18 | charismatic trying to be |
| 85:20 | Charming SM me |
| 85:23 | kind of ah falsely disingenuous it does |
| 85:26 | doesn't come across it doesn't read so |
| 85:28 | you you got to know know what you're |
| 85:29 | dealing with know what you're playing |
| 85:31 | with and there's no judgment |
| 85:33 | particularly on which one it is but it's |
| 85:35 | very sort of interesting thinking about |
| 85:37 | what what you are how people perceive |
| 85:41 | you I because how you're perceived sorry |
| 85:44 | but how you're perceived is so important |
| 85:47 | in our world and it's useful to know |
| 85:51 | because when people meet me and when |
| 85:54 | people see me on TV they have a |
| 85:56 | perception of me now is it true no |
| 86:00 | there's there's more to me than that you |
| 86:01 | know I I I'd suffer a bit with the |
| 86:03 | anxiety I'm very dyslexic not very good |
| 86:06 | at writing I read quite slowly um none |
| 86:10 | of that comes across people just go he's |
| 86:13 | he's all right he's look at him wear in |
| 86:14 | a sharp suit he's really cutting and |
| 86:16 | sardonic he's probably unthinking and |
| 86:19 | what whatever you but knowing that is |
| 86:22 | really useful you don't have to be that |
| 86:25 | person but you know it's it's it's good |
| 86:28 | to know what others think about you I |
| 86:29 | mean there is a thing about Fame where |
| 86:31 | if you wear the mask for long enough The |
| 86:33 | Mask becomes the face yeah you told me |
| 86:35 | that line the other night that took a |
| 86:37 | great right good chunk in my 20s to to |
| 86:40 | realize that um and Al Marcus taught me |
| 86:44 | that the Persona is incapable of |
| 86:46 | receiving love it can only receive |
| 86:48 | praise what he means by that yeah |
| 86:51 |  that's it's very good isn't it |
| 86:53 | correct yeah that was like a because |
| 86:55 | this was when I was probably 20 no must |
| 86:57 | have been 31 I think when he said that |
| 86:59 | to me for the first time like 2019 so |
| 87:01 | only you know only four years ago and |
| 87:03 | I'm still kind |
| 87:05 | of this big name on campus party |
| 87:08 | boyish but I'm also not and I'm feeling |
| 87:11 | this pain so I've got enough distance I |
| 87:13 | think had I have learned it when I |
| 87:14 | needed to hear it I wouldn't have had |
| 87:15 | the perspective to be able to understand |
| 87:17 | it what isn't that the kind of the thing |
| 87:18 | with wisdom is it's you could tell any |
| 87:22 | 18-year-old all of this stuff yeah and |
| 87:24 | it will just different things will |
| 87:26 | resonate at different times so you can't |
| 87:27 | read the same book twice you we talked |
| 87:30 | the other night about Lindy books that's |
| 87:31 | one of the things I got from this |
| 87:32 | podcast which I love I got I listening |
| 87:36 | to this and I was reading Quinton |
| 87:38 | Tarantino's Cinema speculation I just |
| 87:41 | want why am I watching new stuff yeah |
| 87:43 | who gives a about new stuff I want |
| 87:45 | the best stuff yeah so you go back to |
| 87:47 | 1970 Cinema and books that you read |
| 87:50 | years ago that meant something to you |
| 87:52 | and read them again it's that you like |
| 87:54 | no man steps in the same river twice |
| 87:56 | because he's not the same it's not the |
| 87:57 | same river and he's not the same man |
| 87:58 | yeah yeah the |
| 88:00 | um so this |
| 88:03 | like strange idea around the Persona is |
| 88:07 | incapable of receiving love it can only |
| 88:08 | receive |
| 88:10 | praise was really important to me |
| 88:12 | because I realized that I hadn't |
| 88:15 | necessarily felt particularly connected |
| 88:17 | to a lot of the successes in my life I |
| 88:19 | hadn't felt like they really |
| 88:22 | got me right and the reason being that |
| 88:27 | if you are only playing a |
| 88:31 | role everyone's support and Adoration of |
| 88:36 | you will feel in some ways Hollow and |
| 88:40 | shallow because people aren't in love |
| 88:42 | with you they're applauding the role |
| 88:43 | that you |
| 88:45 | play you know we don't love Russell Crow |
| 88:49 | we love Gladiator we don't love love |
| 88:52 | Russell he might be listening to you're |
| 88:53 | his mate so that's different but you |
| 88:55 | know that yeah that thing of um I |
| 88:57 | suppose it is the actor it's that we're |
| 88:59 | playing a role and that role is yeah you |
| 89:04 | you you kind of don't love someone at |
| 89:06 | work they're in a chair they're the boss |
| 89:08 | the whatever they're doing it's not it's |
| 89:11 | it's a part of them but it's not |
| 89:12 | authentically them and that's why you |
| 89:15 | know finding that work life balance |
| 89:17 | where you go you have a place where you |
| 89:18 | can totally be your |
| 89:19 | yourself and be open to |
| 89:23 | love but also it's interesting the love |
| 89:25 | thing is interesting to me just as a |
| 89:27 | sidebar every song for 400 years was |
| 89:31 | about |
| 89:32 | God and every song is about |
| 89:36 | love how do you mean every song's about |
| 89:38 | love right every song used to be about |
| 89:40 | God everything used to every every piece |
| 89:42 | of music pre 1900 was about God |
| 89:45 | everything and now it's about love I |
| 89:48 | mean you could make an argument to say |
| 89:49 | it's the same thing but it's kind it's |
| 89:51 | just interesting to me that that |
| 89:53 | culturally that's kind of what we the |
| 89:57 | gaps well love love as well it's |
| 89:59 | slightly taken over now the love song |
| 90:01 | has you know it feels to me like comedy |
| 90:03 | is having a moment because there it's |
| 90:06 | reflecting back the world in a very |
| 90:08 | interesting way it feels like comedy is |
| 90:10 | having the moment that music maybe had |
| 90:12 | in the 60s and 70s and Cinema had in the |
| 90:13 | 70s where it really connected with |
| 90:16 | people people are connecting with |
| 90:18 | comedians in a way that's I mean listen |
| 90:20 | I'm I'm part of this but I feel like I'm |
| 90:22 | I'm in at the ground level like podcasts |
| 90:25 | are new and we can see podcasts are new |
| 90:27 | because it's like less than 5 years but |
| 90:29 | really comedy's only existed in the |
| 90:31 | current format since I mean who are the |
| 90:34 | who's the John the Baptist you know |
| 90:35 | Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and |
| 90:38 | Richard prior right these guys standing |
| 90:40 | on stage talking for an hour and people |
| 90:42 | just came to see them none of that |
| 90:44 | really happened before there you can |
| 90:46 | trace it back there's never a first but |
| 90:48 | you can trace it back to whenever to to |
| 90:52 | shamanistic um skunk and anany but |
| 90:56 | really it's a very modern thing standup |
| 90:57 | comedy this way of it's an American |
| 90:59 | medium and it |
| 91:02 | feels incredible to be kind of part of |
| 91:04 | that as it and it's rising it feels like |
| 91:07 | it's rising and becoming more important |
| 91:10 | and I don't know I I don't know who the |
| 91:13 | the goats are but I kind of I like to |
| 91:15 | think they're in the future I like to |
| 91:17 | think the goats |
| 91:18 | are you know 12 years old now going |
| 91:22 | through high school like and they're |
| 91:23 | going to be they're going to grow up |
| 91:24 | with this language around them oh I came |
| 91:27 | up with an interesting idea the other |
| 91:28 | day so I was in Brighton uh giving that |
| 91:31 | live talk and then James one of my |
| 91:35 | friends got up on stage and it was |
| 91:37 | packed 1600 people wall to--all in this |
| 91:40 | massive Auditorium in Brighton somewhere |
| 91:42 | and I just wanted to watch his show from |
| 91:43 | the front so he's done what I'm about to |
| 91:46 | start doing a lot he sold out Sydney |
| 91:49 | Opera house he sold out the roundhouse |
| 91:51 | in London and he sold out the Palladium |
| 91:53 | so he's done the thing that I'm about to |
| 91:54 | begin doing with my live show and I was |
| 91:56 | like I'm going to watch the guy not from |
| 91:57 | side stage not from backstage I'm going |
| 91:59 | to observe it I'm going to be |
| 92:00 | out out there with the peasants so |
| 92:03 | descend into the muck and the meire and |
| 92:05 | the feces and the blood sit down during |
| 92:08 | the interval this guy comes over sits in |
| 92:10 | front of me and we get talking and he |
| 92:12 | was uh discussing about how he has |
| 92:18 | changed the way that he sees himself |
| 92:21 | about how he has what I called uh |
| 92:24 | personal growth guilt |
| 92:26 | so survive a guilt someone goes away to |
| 92:29 | war their truck gets blown up all of |
| 92:32 | their friends die he gets stuck in the |
| 92:35 | back but somehow you survive right you |
| 92:37 | maybe you're injured maybe you're not |
| 92:38 | but you get to come home and there's a |
| 92:40 | very specific type of guilt that's |
| 92:43 | associated with that which is |
| 92:48 | his his belief that he should have gone |
| 92:50 | with his friends right that he should |
| 92:52 | have been killed along with them I think |
| 92:53 | this is relatively common amongst |
| 92:55 | soldiers that come back from |
| 92:57 | warp he was talking to me about one of |
| 93:00 | the things that he feels which is like a |
| 93:02 | personal growth guilt that as he begins |
| 93:05 | to pull himself away from these beliefs |
| 93:09 | and insights and Lifestyles that no |
| 93:11 | longer serve |
| 93:13 | him he was starting to feel this degree |
| 93:16 | of guilt for leaving his friends behind |
| 93:18 | in some regard and I thought that was |
| 93:21 | very interesting I think that this is |
| 93:22 | one of the draws that pulls people back |
| 93:25 | into old habits and old patterns that |
| 93:28 | they almost don't believe that they are |
| 93:30 | worthy well it's it's interesting the |
| 93:32 | move to Austin that you've made because |
| 93:35 | that thing of like you can't beat your |
| 93:36 | environment and the idea of I made a |
| 93:39 | move quite early in life I was 16 and I |
| 93:42 | moved |
| 93:43 | schools and it was the first kind of |
| 93:45 | that that sort of discovery that you are |
| 93:49 | who you say you are you know I mean |
| 93:51 | ultimately you'll be judged on what you |
| 93:52 | do not what you say but it was |
| 93:54 | interesting to kind of be able to |
| 93:55 | reinvent myself quite early in life and |
| 93:57 | go well I'm not going to just mess |
| 93:59 | around and uh and you know act crazy at |
| 94:04 | school I'm going to work really hard and |
| 94:06 | go to Cambridge and really apply myself |
| 94:09 | and no one thought it was crazy because |
| 94:12 | I could just turn up in this new place |
| 94:14 | and go hey I'm you know I'm smart enough |
| 94:16 | and I'm going to go to Cambridge and |
| 94:17 | everyone okay |
| 94:19 | great it's interesting now with the like |
| 94:21 | Facebook where I think it's becoming |
| 94:23 | increasingly difficult to distance |
| 94:26 | yourself from the past you're Tethered |
| 94:29 | to your past those those those memories |
| 94:31 | and those photos and those and the |
| 94:33 | friendships and the connections it's |
| 94:35 | just difficult to let go there used to |
| 94:38 | be a high school reunion and you'd meet |
| 94:40 | someone 15 years after you left school |
| 94:42 | and go what have you been up |
| 94:43 | to now you already know it's never going |
| 94:46 | to happen again right because if you're |
| 94:48 | interested you're going to know or |
| 94:49 | you're still connected to them they're |
| 94:51 | following you you they're they're |
| 94:52 | they're still part of your life so you |
| 94:54 | don't get to kind of reinvent yourself |
| 94:55 | and I think it's quite a healthy thing I |
| 94:57 | it depends you might have just come out |
| 94:59 | fully formed and be great but I think |
| 95:01 | for a lot of us it did involve going |
| 95:03 | well look this is what I am now this is |
| 95:04 | what I want to be and I've got a bit of |
| 95:06 | ambition as opposed to entitlement and |
| 95:08 | I'm going to work hard to get to there |
| 95:10 | and sometimes you can be kind of dragged |
| 95:12 | back by friends and family can be |
| 95:14 | incredibly supportive but they can also |
| 95:16 | kind of drag you back there was I had a |
| 95:17 | weird thing a lot of comics have spoken |
| 95:19 | about this the idea of um when you start |
| 95:22 | out you don't really tell your |
| 95:24 | friends you just go and do it and like |
| 95:27 | after I know 10 or 20 or 30 gigs or |
| 95:28 | whatever you tell people you're doing |
| 95:29 | this new thing but by then you're off |
| 95:32 | you you've joined the circus one of my |
| 95:35 | friends has a quote we're not afraid of |
| 95:36 | failure we're afraid of what other |
| 95:38 | people will think of us if we |
| 95:40 | fail yeah which I think is a nice |
| 95:42 | reframe you know I've never understood |
| 95:46 | the quote about you're not afraid of |
| 95:48 | failing you're afraid of what will |
| 95:49 | happen if you succeed no I'm not not no |
| 95:52 | I'm not that's what I'm aiming for I'm |
| 95:54 | afraid of what will happen if I succeed |
| 95:56 | that's what I'm that's literally what |
| 95:57 | I'm trying to do but I think we're |
| 95:59 | afraid of the Judgment of other people |
| 96:00 | if we do fail or that feels pretty on |
| 96:03 | the money to me the and you could live a |
| 96:05 | very you know contained life you scared |
| 96:09 | of being ridiculed you're scared of |
| 96:11 | humiliation you're scared of saying I |
| 96:13 | want to do great things and then not |
| 96:15 | doing great things but I would argue |
| 96:17 | saying you want to do great things and |
| 96:19 | not doing great things is better than |
| 96:20 | just not doing anything not saying |
| 96:22 | anything give it a |
| 96:25 | crack thinking about |
| 96:29 | that that ability to deal with failure |
| 96:33 | that ability to sort of face up to |
| 96:35 | things not going so well and also this |
| 96:38 | well it's there's different failures |
| 96:39 | aren't there there's kind of there's |
| 96:41 | there's recoverable and non-recoverable |
| 96:43 | failures so you tell a joke and it |
| 96:45 | doesn't work very recoverable you got |
| 96:47 | another line straight away locked and |
| 96:49 | loaded we'll try something else and and |
| 96:51 | then if they all don't work all the new |
| 96:52 | lines then you've got the old lines that |
| 96:54 | you know do work so you sort of you're |
| 96:56 | okay and then there's there's there's |
| 96:58 | proper you know kite surfing failures |
| 97:01 | where you |
| 97:03 | drown there different failures right |
| 97:05 | there's different levels of risk and |
| 97:07 | different tolerance for risk so making |
| 97:10 | sensible choices on what could you risk |
| 97:12 | yeah is that seems very sensible George |
| 97:14 | reminded me I I was lamenting about two |
| 97:17 | years ago to George about whether or not |
| 97:21 | George Mack for the people that don't |
| 97:22 | know the mutual George |
| 97:24 | friend about whether or not I should |
| 97:25 | move to Austin and he gave me a frame |
| 97:28 | that was very instructive which is it's |
| 97:30 | a reversible |
| 97:31 | decision yeah you go out there it |
| 97:33 | doesn't work you come back with your |
| 97:34 | tail between your legs maybe you're |
| 97:35 | going to look a little bit silly but |
| 97:37 | it's it's hardly the end of the world |
| 97:39 | reversible and irreversible decisions I |
| 97:41 | think it's such a a lovely I right so if |
| 97:44 | you're looking at something and you're |
| 97:45 | saying well should I should I have these |
| 97:49 | kids that's a big that's a big decision |
| 97:52 | it's really hard to put them back in |
| 97:54 | I've heard yeah I mean even and there's |
| 97:56 | a so there's a real stigma to putting |
| 97:58 | them up for adoption and as a parent |
| 98:00 | there'll be days when you go that might |
| 98:03 | be an angle but you you go that's |
| 98:06 | irreversible that's forever yeah whereas |
| 98:08 | other things are you know pretty easy to |
| 98:11 | reverse so take those |
| 98:13 | risks and you know even but there's |
| 98:15 | certain things I think we're set up to |
| 98:17 | think or the our society set up to tell |
| 98:19 | us losing your job is the worst thing |
| 98:22 | that can happen because you find another |
| 98:24 | job your skill set is the thing that's |
| 98:26 | interesting add to that there's this |
| 98:30 | lovely idea |
| 98:32 | that the skills that you develop along |
| 98:35 | the way of what you are working toward |
| 98:36 | in any case so whatever Pursuit it is |
| 98:39 | that you're going through whatever |
| 98:40 | challenges are Place placed in front of |
| 98:42 | you what you are working toward is not |
| 98:45 | the end goal it is not necessarily even |
| 98:48 | the outcome because whether it fails or |
| 98:50 | whether you succeed the skills that you |
| 98:52 | developed while you were doing this it's |
| 98:54 | kind of analogous to that um it's Karate |
| 98:56 | Kid wipe on wipe off it's |
| 98:59 | also uh analogous to Man's Search for |
| 99:02 | meaning right Victor Frankle But |
| 99:04 | ultimately your ability to respond in |
| 99:06 | any situation is the thing that can |
| 99:08 | never be taken away from you is that not |
| 99:10 | disposition is more important than |
| 99:12 | position yes you know RIT large yes you |
| 99:15 | go people went through ter that life is |
| 99:17 | beautiful movie the idea that you go |
| 99:19 | people went through the worst things in |
| 99:20 | the world they came out |
| 99:21 | there's I I I heard an interview with |
| 99:23 | Esther peral and she said this thing |
| 99:24 | that really kind of shook me and she was |
| 99:26 | talking about her parents were in um the |
| 99:29 | death camps in Germany and she said some |
| 99:32 | people didn't die and some people lived |
| 99:36 | and she talked about like people that |
| 99:38 | have plastic Furniture plastic coverings |
| 99:40 | on the |
| 99:42 | furniture they're waiting to live but |
| 99:45 | they're not living now they they're sort |
| 99:46 | of it's a really interesting analogy cuz |
| 99:49 | I think we all know those people that |
| 99:50 | are saving that room for |
| 99:52 | special but special every day this is it |
| 99:55 | this is you know there's a a lovely |
| 99:58 | frame the original name for this podcast |
| 100:00 | before I woke up at 3: a.m. with modern |
| 100:01 | wisdom six years ago was crushing a che |
| 100:04 | stain and it's a sentence from quite |
| 100:06 | like it sentence from Tim Ferris and he |
| 100:09 | talks about you want to design your life |
| 100:12 | so that the average |
| 100:14 | Tuesday it's pretty good yeah I |
| 100:17 | think so because it's you you're like |
| 100:19 | the the idea of the mountain the idea |
| 100:20 | that you're aiming towards something |
| 100:22 | where you will be satisfied there's |
| 100:24 | always going to be someone that's got it |
| 100:27 | better than you somehow the idea that |
| 100:28 | you're you know comparison is the thief |
| 100:31 | of joy is one of my favorite quotes you |
| 100:34 | just because you're constantly I've sort |
| 100:36 | of got a um holistic theory of jealousy |
| 100:39 | where you you know if you're comparing |
| 100:41 | yourself to someone else you might look |
| 100:42 | at their career and go oh my God they're |
| 100:44 | playing 15 soldout nights at the Oto |
| 100:46 | Arena oh my God they they must be making |
| 100:48 | bank incredible no you have to be |
| 100:51 | jealous of the whole thing take the |
| 100:53 | whole thing correct you need their wife |
| 100:55 | their kids their car their house their |
| 100:58 | life who would you actually swap lives |
| 101:01 | with like there's like I feel like |
| 101:04 | there's no one because you go well this |
| 101:06 | is my I like the adventure I'm on I want |
| 101:09 | to see how this turns out it's like my |
| 101:11 | favorite |
| 101:13 | show yeah I I that I mean that frame |
| 101:16 | changed an awful lot about jealousy for |
| 101:18 | me as well you don't know what the inner |
| 101:21 | texture of Elon Musk or Conor McGregor |
| 101:24 | or Kim Kardashian's mind is it's that |
| 101:27 | thing of like especially with people |
| 101:28 | closer to you than those kind of the the |
| 101:30 | icons the icons are very useful I think |
| 101:32 | um to to really admire people that are |
| 101:34 | doing fabulous things in the world great |
| 101:36 | but that kind of close when you've got |
| 101:38 | someone close to you is is it a real |
| 101:41 | friend or a friend of me so if their |
| 101:44 | success is your |
| 101:45 | success if my friend gets a show and |
| 101:49 | sells out a tour and gets a big break |
| 101:52 | and he's in a movie if I'm ah I wish it |
| 101:55 | was me I can't hang out with that |
| 101:59 | person I can't it's like that would be |
| 102:01 | that's it's poison but if you if you're |
| 102:04 | friends with someone their win is your |
| 102:06 | win yeah like when they get the thing |
| 102:09 | you're like ah incred even if it's a |
| 102:11 | thing you really would aspire to and |
| 102:13 | think was amazing I remember when James |
| 102:15 | Cordon got the show in the states just |
| 102:17 | thinking this is so cool this is like |
| 102:21 | and then you you know you and you can |
| 102:23 | compare yourself to your friends but you |
| 102:24 | go yeah but he's he's got charm for days |
| 102:29 | and he's got skills I don't have what |
| 102:32 | are you gonna do what's your theory on |
| 102:35 | kindness well my theory on kindness |
| 102:38 | would be that we have maybe everyone's |
| 102:42 | very everyone wants to be |
| 102:43 | kind and the problem is the marshmallow |
| 102:47 | test you can have one kindness now or |
| 102:50 | two kindness |
| 102:51 | later and we have to I think as a |
| 102:54 | society as people I think it's the thing |
| 102:56 | that sort of parenting has kind of |
| 102:58 | taught me but just life in general like |
| 103:00 | be kind to yourself be kind to others |
| 103:03 | later you know and and I think we all |
| 103:05 | know that thing of like the kind thing |
| 103:06 | to do now is to go to Gregs and buy some |
| 103:09 | donuts and smash them great get that |
| 103:12 | Sugar hit right now and the Kinder thing |
| 103:14 | to do is to have a salad and feel good |
| 103:17 | tomorrow and with yourself with others |
| 103:21 | just delay it delay it do do the kind of |
| 103:25 | thing it's easy to give in now to whims |
| 103:28 | and desires but actually if you hold |
| 103:31 | back it's |
| 103:35 | better yeah I kindness is kind of like |
| 103:39 | an unsexy thing it feels almost |
| 103:44 | like the sort of thing that's very hard |
| 103:46 | to justify in a capitalistic world one |
| 103:49 | where everyone's striving we are you |
| 103:51 | know you got you got a |
| 103:53 | non-measurable metric y that is |
| 103:55 | incredibly important you know so we talk |
| 103:59 | about uh disposition H tough to measure |
| 104:02 | position oh my God so easy to measure |
| 104:05 | how you doing how many downloads this |
| 104:06 | month how many people listening how many |
| 104:08 | people tweeting what do they say easy |
| 104:11 | disposition not it's about you how you |
| 104:13 | feeling yeah like kindness is is uh and |
| 104:16 | it it comes you're not being |
| 104:18 | kind it's ultimately it's for you |
| 104:21 | it's just a nicer way to |
| 104:23 | live yeah I love this position |
| 104:26 | disposition hidden observable metric |
| 104:29 | frame I really think there's something |
| 104:30 | in there I think they're hidden |
| 104:31 | observable I I think maybe we could |
| 104:33 | apply that to |
| 104:36 | everything you know because what's the |
| 104:39 | the successful show is it's sold |
| 104:42 | out does that make it |
| 104:45 | successful you could fill the room but |
| 104:46 | can you fill it with laughter you know |
| 104:49 | it's it's how are you viewing things |
| 104:50 | like the it's the wrong time scale often |
| 104:53 | people often think of the show as being |
| 104:55 | the show tonight all my show is is a |
| 104:57 | sales pitch for next time that's all it |
| 105:00 | is all the podcast is today is a |
| 105:03 | comeback next week there's more of this |
| 105:06 | it's great and he's chatting to people |
| 105:08 | and this is the kind of conversation he |
| 105:10 | has |
| 105:10 | great it's just doing more it's process |
| 105:13 | driven not outcomes driven do you know |
| 105:15 | what good heart's law is good heart's |
| 105:18 | law good heart's law it sounds like a |
| 105:20 | sequence to a |
| 105:21 | movie it's kind of the people that |
| 105:23 | brought you how'd you let them Apple |
| 105:25 | kind of kind of like Parkinson's law so |
| 105:27 | Parkinson's law says that work expands |
| 105:30 | to fill the time given for it okay |
| 105:32 | fundamentally |
| 105:33 | the it's the justification for time |
| 105:35 | blocking in productivity strategy it's |
| 105:38 | why you completed your University |
| 105:39 | assignments the night before they were |
| 105:41 | duing or sometimes if you were me |
| 105:42 | throughout the entire night before they |
| 105:44 | were do in yeah what's that great line |
| 105:46 | the I think it's Dickens said I would I |
| 105:48 | would have written you a shorter letter |
| 105:50 | but I didn't didn't have the |
| 105:53 | time so that's Parkinson's law good |
| 105:56 | heart's law says when a measure becomes |
| 105:59 | an outcome it ceases to be a good |
| 106:02 | measure so when it's the over Reliance |
| 106:05 | on dashboards for everything right yeah |
| 106:08 | if I was to optimize on the podcast for |
| 106:10 | plays right that's a measure plays are a |
| 106:14 | measure of the success of the podcast if |
| 106:16 | I begin to use that measure as an |
| 106:18 | outcome it no longer is a good measure |
| 106:20 | because it doesn't measure the thing |
| 106:21 | that it's supposed to measure right I |
| 106:24 | could get lots and lots of email |
| 106:26 | addresses by posting all over the |
| 106:29 | Internet sign up to my mailing list and |
| 106:31 | every single person that signs up will |
| 106:33 | get ,000 right people will then sign up |
| 106:36 | and I won't give him ,000 pounds because |
| 106:37 | I'm not going to do that so the metric |
| 106:39 | of acquire as many email addresses as I |
| 106:41 | can good did that yeah but the actual |
| 106:46 | outcome I wanted was accumulate lots of |
| 106:49 | people on a maing list who actually want |
| 106:51 | to hear from me who trust in me and are |
| 106:53 | going to click on links and are going to |
| 106:54 | care about what I've got to say like |
| 106:55 | that's the actual outcome can I ask |
| 106:57 | about that like sidebar but the I like |
| 107:00 | the email that you sent I I'd rather you |
| 107:03 | said it you want me to dictate it don't |
| 107:06 | I'd rather that was a mini podcast that |
| 107:08 | came at the beginning of the show here's |
| 107:10 | what I've been thinking about I'd rather |
| 107:12 | it was just a because it's often that |
| 107:13 | thing if you go I'm listening to it I I |
| 107:16 | kind of |
| 107:17 | uh you know I like it I like those |
| 107:21 | things those thoughts but for me it's |
| 107:23 | the the medium is the message and for |
| 107:26 | you it seems to be podcasts are and I |
| 107:28 | think actually if you put those together |
| 107:30 | I think maybe that's the |
| 107:32 | book that's it's it's taking these |
| 107:34 | little things so you're you're sort of |
| 107:36 | the process is you're writing it as you |
| 107:37 | kind of go along and you're taking those |
| 107:39 | those things that really resonate with |
| 107:40 | people and I don't disagree I mean it's |
| 107:43 | it's the thing that fires me up the most |
| 107:45 | to do this like whatever we want to call |
| 107:47 | it bro philosophy like common guy life |
| 107:50 | Insight stuff I really like it I like |
| 107:53 | bringing those two things together but |
| 107:54 | have you seen you know Jonathan height |
| 107:56 | right hate height uh he's writing his |
| 108:00 | next book in public it's really |
| 108:01 | interesting way he the coddling of the |
| 108:03 | American mind that guy yeah that's a |
| 108:04 | great book yeah fantastic and then he he |
| 108:07 | wrote this uh great essay for the |
| 108:08 | Washington Post I think called the Tower |
| 108:10 | of Babel and it's kind of a development |
| 108:13 | on from where he was coddling of the |
| 108:15 | American mind he's s big into this |
| 108:17 | antisocial media thing he's concerned |
| 108:19 | about what it's doing to especially |
| 108:21 | young girls sense of self and anxiety |
| 108:24 | and so on and so forth however what he's |
| 108:26 | doing on his maybe substack maybe |
| 108:28 | something else he's writing the book |
| 108:30 | chapter by chapter publishing it maybe |
| 108:34 | just to paying members or maybe for free |
| 108:36 | to everybody they just getting feedback |
| 108:38 | on getting feedback and iterating so he |
| 108:40 | will have released every single chapter |
| 108:42 | of his book's first draft for largely |
| 108:46 | free over the space of a year or 18 |
| 108:49 | months it's a great idea it's kind of |
| 108:50 | the wisdom of crowns if you think about |
| 108:51 | music as well like the great bands often |
| 108:54 | go out and play it first before they |
| 108:57 | finish the album they go and play it and |
| 108:59 | see what the reaction is it's it's |
| 109:02 | interesting like you know it's I suppose |
| 109:05 | the not looking behind the Wizard's |
| 109:07 | curtain but like with great stand-up |
| 109:09 | comedians like when you see Chris Rock |
| 109:11 | do an hour you go yeah well he he wrote |
| 109:14 | probably 2,000 jokes in order to do |
| 109:16 | those 70 that worked brilliantly and in |
| 109:19 | order to do those he put how much time |
| 109:21 | in and he you know you want to road test |
| 109:25 | it you don't want to do all new |
| 109:28 | material I came up with an idea which is |
| 109:30 | similar to something you talk about a |
| 109:32 | lot you call it the quarter life crisis |
| 109:35 | and I called it the Mano |
| 109:37 | pause pause is nice yeah it's nice but |
| 109:40 | it's the it's it's early right it's that |
| 109:43 | mid 20s I think it's when you start to |
| 109:45 | make your first decision in life so |
| 109:48 | pretty much on a treadmill if you think |
| 109:49 | about it from from the age of five you |
| 109:51 | go into the education system and it was |
| 109:53 | great when we had an Empire because we |
| 109:55 | needed people that went through the |
| 109:57 | education system to go and run the |
| 109:58 | Empire that was what it was for that's |
| 110:00 | the what the education system in Britain |
| 110:01 | that's kind of gone out to the Western |
| 110:03 | world was for now not so much so this |
| 110:06 | idea that it's exams at all these stages |
| 110:09 | and you know what the metric is you know |
| 110:10 | what the measurable is so the measurable |
| 110:13 | isn't what you found now which is the |
| 110:16 | joy of learning the joy of reading the |
| 110:19 | joy of ideas |
| 110:20 | that's what school should be about but |
| 110:23 | it isn't it's about passing exams and |
| 110:25 | get to did I choose to stay on and do |
| 110:27 | aels no no the obvious thing to do after |
| 110:31 | you're 16 you do stay on and that |
| 110:34 | everyone goes to University I mean |
| 110:35 | everyone goes to University now and you |
| 110:37 | go to the best one you can so to |
| 110:38 | Cambridge and then after Cambridge what |
| 110:40 | do you do well everyone's getting a job |
| 110:41 | now they've got to get a job who do I |
| 110:43 | get a job with well the biggest blue |
| 110:44 | chip company I can find yay so you get a |
| 110:48 | job and then you kind of turn around |
| 110:51 | what a year two years depending on how |
| 110:52 | bright you are I'm not that bright about |
| 110:54 | two years in I kind of went the am |
| 110:56 | I doing you that great quote of every |
| 110:58 | man's got two lives and the second |
| 111:01 | begins when he realizes he's only got |
| 111:03 | one and that so you get off the |
| 111:07 | treadmill and go what and then it's very |
| 111:10 | it's there's a book called um what color |
| 111:11 | is your parachute which I read at the |
| 111:13 | time which is kind of a asking questions |
| 111:16 | that lead you to that what are you going |
| 111:18 | to do there's loads of that kind of self |
| 111:20 | stuff on the internet now which is I |
| 111:21 | always think it's like uh it's |
| 111:23 | horoscopes for people with a |
| 111:26 | levels you know the kind of whether it's |
| 111:28 | Mya's Brig or whatever but those are |
| 111:30 | fascinating because you kind of go why |
| 111:31 | do people like horoscopes I just want to |
| 111:33 | read about myself yeah just yeah I'm I'm |
| 111:36 | a little bit self-obsessed and |
| 111:37 | narcisstic but doing those |
| 111:47 | person my Edge what's the thing that I |
| 111:50 | do that I find easy that other people |
| 111:51 | find difficult and there's a little bit |
| 111:52 | of gold there and I could pursue that |
| 111:55 | that would be a that would be a purpose |
| 111:57 | that would be something that's a true |
| 111:58 | north and um is it uh tiic and anti-ck |
| 112:03 | you pronounced it differently to me I |
| 112:04 | don't telic and exoic yeah I've only |
| 112:06 | ever seen it written down uh it's weird |
| 112:09 | I kind of like that when you don't know |
| 112:11 | yeah uh but the but that idea of like |
| 112:14 | tasks Without End will make you happy |
| 112:16 | tasks with an end can be a bit |
| 112:17 | depressing if you get to the end of a |
| 112:19 | project |
| 112:20 | and it's done huh finite in infinite |
| 112:23 | games isn't it yeah yeah I uh that |
| 112:26 | manopause thing it came about I first |
| 112:28 | called it the fitness menopause so I |
| 112:30 | noticed around about |
| 112:32 | 20 27 26 27 that I |
| 112:37 | was all of the training strategies that |
| 112:40 | I'd been relying on like Push Pull legs |
| 112:42 | and bro split and I was looked fantastic |
| 112:45 | but kind of got out of breath going up a |
| 112:47 | set of stairs and I couldn't bend over |
| 112:48 | and touch my toes all the rest of it so |
| 112:52 | what I realized was I I probably should |
| 112:54 | try and pivot my training and I saw it |
| 112:56 | with a lot of my friends a lot of the |
| 112:57 | guys that are listening to this podcast |
| 112:59 | will feel this as well the training |
| 113:00 | protocol that you followed especially if |
| 113:02 | it's a bro split through your 20s you |
| 113:04 | get toward the end of your 20s and I'm |
| 113:06 | like ah am I steeping in my own Neurosis |
| 113:09 | powered by 500 milligrams of caffeine |
| 113:11 | looking at myself in the mirror I'm kind |
| 113:12 | of done with this and then people pivot |
| 113:14 | and they start doing yoga or they do |
| 113:16 | Brazilian jiu-jitsu or they do |
| 113:18 | kickboxing and they go and try CrossFit |
| 113:20 | they do whatever and I noticed that |
| 113:22 | first but it was actually the lead |
| 113:24 | measure of a whole bunch of other |
| 113:25 | changes which was the things that I |
| 113:28 | thought served |
| 113:30 | me in my |
| 113:32 | 20s weren't |
| 113:35 | self-authored the things that I thought |
| 113:37 | I wanted and the things that I wanted to |
| 113:40 | want had diverged I didn't want the |
| 113:43 | things that I wanted right I actually |
| 113:46 | when I looked sufficiently |
| 113:48 | deep well is that I mean the what do you |
| 113:50 | want to want as a question is I mean |
| 113:53 | that should be the name of the book it's |
| 113:55 | so good it's so good but that |
| 113:58 | thing of I didn't want what I wanted is |
| 114:01 | dopamine that's just dopamine it's the |
| 114:03 | idea of going no the chase was the thing |
| 114:06 | the chase was your reward so when you go |
| 114:08 | shopping and you buy the the watch the |
| 114:11 | car the whatever the the trinket is that |
| 114:14 | you thought you wanted that represented |
| 114:16 | something and then you get it and it's a |
| 114:17 | bit blah it's that how many times do you |
| 114:21 | have to do that before you realize okay |
| 114:23 | trinkets aren't for me there's nothing |
| 114:25 | in |
| 114:26 | trinkets you're you're the ambition |
| 114:28 | should be emotions can I spin you a yarn |
| 114:30 | about the pineapple the pineapple yes |
| 114:33 | not much you can tell me about |
| 114:34 | pineapples but yeah sure very important |
| 114:36 | fruit let me show you that you're wrong |
| 114:38 | so 1492 Christopher Columbus lands on |
| 114:41 | the island of |
| 114:43 | Guadalupe and for the first time ever |
| 114:45 | Western person discovers the pineapple |
| 114:47 | kind of looks like a royal fruit right |
| 114:49 | it's got little little Crown true on its |
| 114:51 | head and he describes in his journal |
| 114:53 | eating it if you've never had a |
| 114:54 | pineapple before and you hadn't had |
| 114:56 | other fruits that were sort of created |
| 114:57 | outside of the UK stuff like apples and |
| 114:59 | stuff the pineapple is overpowered as |
| 115:01 |  like it's a Superfruit right it's |
| 115:03 | so sweet and juicy nice anyway describes |
| 115:06 | it brings it back right uh Prince or |
| 115:09 | King Ferdinand II of Aragon king of |
| 115:12 | Spain I think he takes it back to First |
| 115:15 | and they take a literally |
| 115:17 | boatload take all of these ones back one |
| 115:20 | isn't rotten when he brings it back it |
| 115:21 | gets given to the king so the first |
| 115:24 | pineapple that's ever eaten by somebody |
| 115:25 | who's a Westerner is it's done in a very |
| 115:28 | sort of ceremonial fashion this myth |
| 115:32 | about the pineapple propagates and after |
| 115:35 | a little while trade begins to improve a |
| 115:38 | little bit the pineapple becomes one of |
| 115:40 | the most ostentatious displays of wealth |
| 115:43 | that anybody in the British aristocracy |
| 115:44 | can rely on for about 300 years you know |
| 115:46 | you know on the Strand in London is |
| 115:48 | there a pineapple used to be able to |
| 115:50 | rent pineapples $8,000 oh £8,000 is the |
| 115:54 | equivalent of what it would cost but |
| 115:56 | people would rent them for dinner |
| 115:57 | parties they would parade them round |
| 116:00 | look yeah look at this and they would |
| 116:01 | have statues out front of the estate as |
| 116:05 | if to say you know what the gag is on |
| 116:06 | the Statue so the pineapple um I'll go |
| 116:09 | toe to do on pineapples so on Stately |
| 116:11 | homes they'll often have a stone |
| 116:13 | pineapple out the front and it's a |
| 116:16 | gag so the gag is when sailors would |
| 116:18 | come back from the West Indies they'd |
| 116:21 | often bring a pineapple M and they would |
| 116:23 | put the pineapple in the window the |
| 116:26 | girls would put the pineapple and the |
| 116:27 | pineapple kind of meant no gentleman |
| 116:29 | callers my husband's home uh and he's a |
| 116:32 | sailor and that gag that gag has been |
| 116:35 | lost in the in the M but the the |
| 116:37 | aristocracy put a pineapple at the front |
| 116:39 | of their house it kind it was kind of a |
| 116:41 | joke it was a reference to that but the |
| 116:43 | joke got lost so that's interesting I |
| 116:46 | didn't know that you're teaching me |
| 116:47 | things about pineapples here pineapples |
| 116:49 | once but the my friend wrote a book |
| 116:51 | about Pineapples uh but that thing in |
| 116:53 | the Strand you could yeah you could rent |
| 116:54 | pineapples and you would show them off |
| 116:55 | and then and then suddenly that thing |
| 116:59 | that they was the most lorded special |
| 117:02 | thing ain't nothing and see where I'm |
| 117:05 | going you look at it now and you go |
| 117:07 | what's the thing there's nothing you can |
| 117:09 | buy in a shopping mall that you will |
| 117:11 | give a about in 10 |
| 117:13 | years nothing there's nothing for you |
| 117:16 | there fast forward do something for you |
| 117:18 | in 5 years time don't buy the thing you |
| 117:19 | don't need it so that story about the |
| 117:23 | pineapple and its subsequent demise when |
| 117:25 | the French invent green houses and you |
| 117:27 | can grow fruits from much more tropical |
| 117:30 | climates where we are uh related to a |
| 117:34 | lesson that Rogan taught me when I went |
| 117:36 | on his show last year and I called it |
| 117:38 | Rogan's value difficulty conflation look |
| 117:41 | at the car he's driving look at the |
| 117:42 | watch he's wearing look at the girl he's |
| 117:44 | with that's unattainable to many people |
| 117:46 | so it seems like it's valuable but then |
| 117:49 | you ained it and then you realized oh |
| 117:52 | this isn't valuable this is just |
| 117:53 | difficult to get and there's a |
| 117:55 | difference there's a big difference |
| 117:56 | what's valuable is something that |
| 117:57 | fulfills you intellectually emotionally |
| 117:59 | spiritually and lovingly most smart |
| 118:02 | people realize that there is value in |
| 118:04 | stepping outside of their comfort that |
| 118:06 | on the other side of discomfort is |
| 118:07 | something valuable we're told that |
| 118:09 | worthwhile things are difficult to |
| 118:10 | attain because if they weren't difficult |
| 118:12 | to attain they wouldn't be worthwhile |
| 118:15 | this is how non-valuable but difficult |
| 118:17 | things get slipped into our design |
| 118:19 | without us noticing attaining something |
| 118:21 | worthwhile is often going to be |
| 118:23 | difficult but just because it's |
| 118:25 | difficult doesn't mean it's worthwhile |
| 118:28 | we use the challenge as a proxy for |
| 118:29 | virtue or value or alignment or |
| 118:31 | Integrity there's some signaling going |
| 118:33 | on here too difficult things by Design |
| 118:35 | will be attained by a small number of |
| 118:36 | people which makes them desirable simply |
| 118:38 | because it's an easy way to stand out |
| 118:39 | from the crowd but just because it's |
| 118:42 | difficult to attain does not mean that |
| 118:43 | it's valuable I mean that's great the |
| 118:46 | only thing I would take issue with there |
| 118:47 | is most smart people realize |
| 118:50 | no no they don't and I can prove |
| 118:53 | it |
| 118:54 | Yachts |
| 118:56 | Yachts someone's bought a yacht |
| 118:58 | someone's buying a yacht today |
| 119:01 | Yachts great there's a level at which |
| 119:04 | people are just maybe okay if you don't |
| 119:08 | enjoy a conversation with a friend |
| 119:11 | you're not going to enjoy a |
| 119:12 | yacht what do you think you're doing on |
| 119:14 | the |
| 119:18 | yacht yeah well I mean that nval quote |
| 119:20 | if you can't be happy with a coffee you |
| 119:22 | won't be happy on a yacht yeah is it's |
| 119:24 | perfect right yeah it's perfect it |
| 119:27 | because you you go that is it's so true |
| 119:30 | how early in life can you know that how |
| 119:34 | what age do you have to be before you |
| 119:36 | can go ah you're chasing rainbows this |
| 119:39 | is there's nothing that external stuff |
| 119:42 | isn't going to bring you the thing that |
| 119:43 | you want but how much of a quest you |
| 119:45 | need to go |
| 119:46 | on before you can sort of |
| 119:50 | realize that but that's the you know |
| 119:52 | that's been a repeating theme throughout |
| 119:53 | today about you can bestow all of these |
| 119:58 | insights but the 18-year-old version of |
| 120:01 | me wouldn't have listened to this in any |
| 120:02 | case and it seems like even if someone |
| 120:05 | shows you a photo of the top of the |
| 120:07 | mountain this is what it looks like this |
| 120:08 | was the route that I took to get there |
| 120:10 | here were the pitfalls that you should |
| 120:11 | avoid |
| 120:13 | ultimately it takes a very singular |
| 120:15 | person to be able to learn from the |
| 120:17 | mistakes of others rather than the |
| 120:18 | mistakes of Who had who had that line |
| 120:20 | about it was climbing Everest or |
| 120:22 | whatever and someone someone Cho it up |
| 120:24 | there it wasn't Everest it was another |
| 120:26 | Mountain but like they didn't climb up |
| 120:28 | they got a chopper up took some photos |
| 120:31 | and |
| 120:32 | went it's a nothing |
| 120:34 | experience who cares might as well just |
| 120:37 | get you can get sent some photos like |
| 120:39 | there's nothing in that like doing that |
| 120:42 | wanted to do that pilgrimage but I |
| 120:44 | thought I'll do it real quick so I did |
| 120:46 | it on a jet ski it's not anything if if |
| 120:48 | you're if you're not not willing to take |
| 120:49 | the journey yourself it's you got |
| 120:51 | nothing it's interesting that thing of |
| 120:53 | the manopause that you had 26 27 that LE |
| 120:57 | leaks to links to the um uh the |
| 121:01 | developmental kind of biology of the |
| 121:03 | when's the brain finished yeah it's |
| 121:04 | interesting your brain was just finished |
| 121:06 | yeah what do I think about 25 for guys |
| 121:09 | is it 24 for women it's like but it's |
| 121:11 | that old that we're fully integrated |
| 121:15 | ready to |
| 121:17 | go and and at that age miraculously |
| 121:20 | about 12 months in you went well this is |
| 121:22 | nonsense I got to do something else yeah |
| 121:24 | yeah I I see it I see it in a lot of |
| 121:26 | people um we spoke the other night about |
| 121:30 | inner critics what you think the |
| 121:32 | relationship that we should have with |
| 121:33 | our inner |
| 121:34 | critic I mean I think it's it's |
| 121:36 | interesting Walt Disney had three |
| 121:37 | different rooms so he had a room to be |
| 121:40 | creative right just come up with ideas |
| 121:43 | no bad ideas great other than some of |
| 121:45 | the anti-Semitism anyway so he's got his |
| 121:48 | ideas room and then he's got his um he's |
| 121:51 | got his management room well how how do |
| 121:53 | we make those room how do we make those |
| 121:55 | ideas happen how are we going to make |
| 121:57 | that stuff happen and then you had |
| 121:59 | another room for |
| 122:01 | criticism and I think we should sort of |
| 122:03 | think about the inner critic like that |
| 122:04 | the idea of going if you're trying to do |
| 122:05 | something creative don't let the critic |
| 122:08 | in too |
| 122:09 | soon wait until you've had the whole |
| 122:11 | idea wait until you've let the |
| 122:13 | management get involved a little bit |
| 122:16 | wait until you've tried to write the |
| 122:17 | whole joke and come at it from from a |
| 122:19 | few different angles and tried it twice |
| 122:21 | before you critic you criticize it and |
| 122:24 | Outsourcing your critic I think is is |
| 122:26 | smart I mean comedy does it with the |
| 122:27 | audience really they make the decision |
| 122:29 | as to what the show is they do the |
| 122:31 | editing for |
| 122:33 | me do you got a much better relationship |
| 122:36 | with failure with that it it engenders a |
| 122:39 | much better relationship with failure |
| 122:41 | yeah because it's not identity level |
| 122:43 | yeah the jokes of the bullets I'm the |
| 122:45 | gun like easy come easy go yeah so you |
| 122:49 | let go of it you know but also when |
| 122:50 | you're doing something creative you got |
| 122:51 | to kill a lot of |
| 122:53 | babies they're all very precious to you |
| 122:55 | and you think they're fa there a |
| 122:56 | fabulous little idea and it's nothing |
| 122:58 | audience just stared at you okay all TR |
| 123:03 | the next one yeah that was swinging a |
| 123:04 | Miss yeah great but that isn't that kind |
| 123:07 | of a nice attitude for it's hard though |
| 123:09 | when you've made something that's you if |
| 123:10 | it's a movie or a a book that you've |
| 123:13 | worked on for years but that super smart |
| 123:16 | uh guy trying every chapter as he goes |
| 123:20 | along that's super smart yeah low stakes |
| 123:23 | low pressure creativity is something I |
| 123:26 | wonder whether it's played into by this |
| 123:28 | sort of concretizing of everything that |
| 123:31 | you've ever |
| 123:33 | said throughout all of time being there |
| 123:36 | that it doesn't feel like the ephemeral |
| 123:38 | can be ephemeral anymore you can't just |
| 123:40 | blast it out it's iPhones at a comedy |
| 123:42 | show are kind of the en enemy of |
| 123:44 | creativity censorship is not a problem |
| 123:46 | in |
| 123:46 | comedy self-censorship is a huge problem |
| 123:50 | people not saying the unsayable risky |
| 123:54 | thing that could be the funniest |
| 123:56 |  because they're worried well if |
| 123:58 | that's taken out of context what if |
| 124:00 | people don't understand I mean like why |
| 124:02 | do people like comedy there's a lot of |
| 124:03 | nuance in comedy isn't there there's no |
| 124:05 | Nuance in the modern world there's no |
| 124:08 | Nuance in in you know what's reported in |
| 124:10 | the media it's all a weird newsp and |
| 124:13 | then in comedy like you can say the |
| 124:15 | craziest and people know it's not |
| 124:17 | yeah there's no hate in his did fun did |
| 124:20 | you see uh Rosanne get popped for that |
| 124:23 | little bit she did with theovon she was |
| 124:25 | making a joke about the Jews and she |
| 124:28 | basically said that not enough of them |
| 124:29 | were she she was it was the most |
| 124:34 | probably the most |
| 124:36 | egregious clipping of a bit Yeah seen I |
| 124:41 | didn't see it so I can't really comment |
| 124:42 | but the idea of like the bad faith |
| 124:44 | argument that journalists make of going |
| 124:47 | I know it's a joke |
| 124:49 | it was in a comedy show at a comedy club |
| 124:52 | that's the context it was a joke and |
| 124:55 | they go okay well let's report it as if |
| 124:57 | it was a statement that was made ladies |
| 124:59 | and gentlemen can I get your attention I |
| 125:00 | to make a comment here about no no one |
| 125:03 | said |
| 125:04 | that she'd made a bunch |
| 125:08 | of |
| 125:09 | obviously sarcastic very overthe |
| 125:13 | toop opposite statements it was like and |
| 125:17 | the pigs will fly and the sky is green |
| 125:20 | and the D D D D D basically for for ages |
| 125:22 | and ages and ages and ages and ages and |
| 125:24 | then at the very end said like and not |
| 125:27 | in your Jews summ summ summing it was |
| 125:30 | part of it was an Ever escalating |
| 125:32 | statement about the Ridiculousness of |
| 125:34 | some of the claims that were being made |
| 125:36 | with some some something and they just |
| 125:37 | took the bit at the end yeah and I was |
| 125:39 | like come on you know I'm all for saying |
| 125:43 | you know this needs to be able to stand |
| 125:45 | up on its own |
| 125:46 | like things can be taken in a little bit |
| 125:49 | of isolation but not that much |
| 125:51 | isolation yeah it is interesting though |
| 125:53 | isn't it the idea of you go well you |
| 125:56 | could take anything out of context and |
| 125:58 | someone's going to be upset as well also |
| 125:59 | you've got how much access to people now |
| 126:02 | everyone's got to say it used to be that |
| 126:04 | would have been an eye roll and a touch |
| 126:06 | from someone right someone said that not |
| 126:08 | for me thank you won't be buying a |
| 126:10 | ticket I won't go and now it's the the |
| 126:13 | idea of saying I don't like that seems |
| 126:15 | very reasonable to me no one should have |
| 126:17 | access to that seems like a different |
| 126:19 | thing so you know the free speech thing |
| 126:21 | is you go well until we find a better |
| 126:23 | system we have to have free speech what |
| 126:26 | about Chinese system that's a good |
| 126:28 | system yeah I mean I mean that's the |
| 126:30 | world we could be living in you know |
| 126:32 | where I mean it's you know Charlie Brook |
| 126:34 | is a mate of mine and that those kind of |
| 126:35 | black mirrors where people are getting |
| 126:37 | so social points and then it's happened |
| 126:41 | I it's happening right now it's |
| 126:43 | unbelievable it's |
| 126:44 | like 1984 is happening right now you |
| 126:48 | know that they've got got in China Gate |
| 126:50 | analysis that can work out even face |
| 126:53 | covered wearing clothes can work out who |
| 126:56 | someone is with about 90% plus accuracy |
| 126:59 | just from the way that they walk so |
| 127:03 | hiding your face hiding everything |
| 127:06 | dressing differently doing whatever |
| 127:08 | isn't sufficient to protect you now |
| 127:10 | they've fingerprinted your uh yeah |
| 127:13 | movement it's interesting that thing of |
| 127:15 | like the micro the macro so you can't |
| 127:17 | move |
| 127:20 | privately but I think maybe with social |
| 127:22 | media now you can't think |
| 127:25 | privately because everything's um it |
| 127:29 | becomes slightly |
| 127:30 | performative and there's no |
| 127:33 | boredom you're constantly stimulated I |
| 127:35 | think we're slightly over stimulated as |
| 127:37 | a society like being bored is really |
| 127:39 | good for creativity being a bit bored |
| 127:42 | and a bit like listless you know |
| 127:44 | sometimes I look even now it happens but |
| 127:46 | it used to happen more previously at how |
| 127:49 | many things I'll be doing at once so |
| 127:52 | I'll be replying to an email whilst I'm |
| 127:54 | waiting for the cattle to boil I'll be |
| 127:56 | setting the dishwasher away whilst |
| 127:58 | listening to a podcast at two times |
| 128:00 | speed and I'll be waiting for somebody |
| 128:02 | I'm like I've got like I I'm literally |
| 128:05 | waiting for five things to happen while |
| 128:07 | doing three that's the modern condition |
| 128:09 | though isn't it that you're you're so uh |
| 128:11 | addicted to |
| 128:13 | activity doing something and feeling |
| 128:16 | like you're being productive and |
| 128:17 | actually just letting s kind of s having |
| 128:19 | some time just to think it's the Charlie |
| 128:21 | Munga thing isn't it the idea of waiting |
| 128:23 | and just having time just to think and |
| 128:27 | do |
| 128:27 | nothing read |
| 128:30 | stuff read what's your the you've got a |
| 128:32 | theory on the Chinese what's your theory |
| 128:33 | about the Chinese my theory on the CH |
| 128:35 | Chinese the same Theory as uh um well my |
| 128:39 | theory on the Chinese we don't need to |
| 128:41 | worry there are covers ban the Rolling |
| 128:43 | Stones are not worried about the bootleg |
| 128:45 | Rolling Stones right because they're the |
| 128:47 | Rolling Stones they're coming up with |
| 128:48 | this and playing it and someone's |
| 128:50 | doing a cover version China at the |
| 128:52 | moment is a is a is a covers band and |
| 128:55 | there's something there's some sweet |
| 128:57 | Source in our system where Innovation is |
| 129:00 | created and we're coming up with stuff |
| 129:03 | and you look at the five biggest |
| 129:05 | companies in the world and they're all |
| 129:06 | tech companies that came up in the last |
| 129:09 | 10 years 15 years whatever it is it's |
| 129:12 | incredible The Innovation that we have |
| 129:14 | you don't need to to worry about it it's |
| 129:16 | like AI I'm not worried about AI |
| 129:19 | it's artificial intelligence as soon as |
| 129:21 | it's artificial |
| 129:23 | Consciousness great I'll be concerned |
| 129:26 | that all can can computers write jokes |
| 129:28 | yeah when they start laughing at jokes |
| 129:30 | that's that's when there'll be a problem |
| 129:33 | there was this I think it was George |
| 129:34 | that taught me this one as well um a |
| 129:37 | really good measure of AI will be I |
| 129:40 | think it's called stairway wit you heard |
| 129:43 | of this stairway wit stairway wit or |
| 129:46 | stairwell wit so um Spirit discal the |
| 129:49 | French term for you know when you have a |
| 129:51 | dinner with someone and you you're |
| 129:53 | walking down the stairs from the |
| 129:54 | restaurant and you think I wish I'd said |
| 129:56 | that correct is that the yes yes what's |
| 129:59 | what's that called Spirit discal I'm |
| 130:02 | going to guess that means the spirit of |
| 130:03 | the |
| 130:04 | staircase yeah there you go there you go |
| 130:07 | the French they've always going to make |
| 130:08 | everything so much more I think it's |
| 130:10 | because the restaurants were often on |
| 130:12 | the floor Upper Floor and you walk down |
| 130:14 | the steps that's cool so that was their |
| 130:17 | it's a French think and the French are |
| 130:21 | like genetically not very funny so |
| 130:24 | presumably yeah they are who's funny you |
| 130:26 | said that um Gad there's a guy called |
| 130:29 | Gad it's very funny um there's a girl |
| 130:31 | called um oh what she called come back |
| 130:34 | to me in one second |
| 130:36 | um |
| 130:38 | oh I'm blanking on her name because the |
| 130:41 | French used to dat uh blanch gardan is I |
| 130:45 | watched it that's a French name |
| 130:47 | I don't speak French I watched it in |
| 130:49 | French with subtitles blanch Gan special |
| 130:51 | blew my mind really so |
| 130:54 | maybe spoken too soon no this incredible |
| 130:56 | funny funny people everywhere but that |
| 130:58 | um it's weird the uh the stairs thing |
| 131:00 | this is very on a tangent but it's |
| 131:03 | interesting let's talk about the |
| 131:04 | environment |
| 131:05 | again okay so are you aware of New York |
| 131:09 | at the uh turn of the century okay so |
| 131:12 | New York turn of the century incredibly |
| 131:14 | loud every street is cobbled seen gangs |
| 131:16 | in New York you get the visual right |
| 131:17 | every stre is cobbled horse and carts |
| 131:19 | everywhere and people on Horseback right |
| 131:20 | cuz you got to get around the horse |
| 131:22 | is yay deep okay uh when horses die they |
| 131:27 | die in the street and they have to wait |
| 131:28 | for them to atropy slightly before they |
| 131:30 | cut them up |
| 131:32 | manually and cut them off so you know |
| 131:34 | that kind of Trope about you've heard |
| 131:36 | about smelling salts and people talk |
| 131:37 | about it's fetch the smelling salts it's |
| 131:39 | from that |
| 131:40 | era London was the same but New York had |
| 131:43 | it really bad because it's an island so |
| 131:46 | you know there the steps going up to the |
| 131:48 | Brownstones the steps going up to the |
| 131:50 | Brownstone buildings with a little metal |
| 131:52 | scraper and that was so you could walk |
| 131:54 | out of the and scrape it off your |
| 131:56 | feet before you went into the |
| 131:58 | house covered in the whole of New |
| 132:00 | York was covered in and they they |
| 132:02 | had a law and they wrote a law about it |
| 132:04 | and then another law and then they |
| 132:06 | brought in a tax and then they brought |
| 132:07 | in another tax and another law and |
| 132:08 | another law or that nothing changed it |
| 132:12 | was covered in and it smelled awful |
| 132:13 | and it was |
| 132:15 | hell and then Henry Ford came along |
| 132:20 | and horses went |
| 132:22 | from a million horses to six of them now |
| 132:26 | in Central Park taking tourists around |
| 132:29 | and no more horeshit problem and I kind |
| 132:33 | of I kind of think things can change |
| 132:35 | very |
| 132:36 | quickly I mean maybe that's a |
| 132:38 | ludicrously optimistic view of the world |
| 132:41 | because the biggest industry in the |
| 132:42 | world in 1902 was |
| 132:45 | whaling you're kidding no biggest |
| 132:47 | industry in the world was wailing |
| 132:49 | because they would need the blubber and |
| 132:51 | the oil for lamps the oil was everything |
| 132:55 | right you know what's a resource is a |
| 132:57 | really interesting question so you go |
| 132:59 | that that oil from Wales was a resource |
| 133:01 | and we didn't wipe out the Wales but we |
| 133:03 | came as close as you'd ever want to get |
| 133:05 | and then suddenly a bit of tech came |
| 133:06 | along and and saved them yeah um I mean |
| 133:10 | it's it's it's the it's kind of a little |
| 133:12 | bit tropy but one of the best ways to |
| 133:15 | ensure that people pivot from a behavior |
| 133:16 | that they do to a behavior that you want |
| 133:18 | is to make the behavior that you want |
| 133:20 | more attractive than the behavior that |
| 133:21 | they do it's the way that Elon Musk |
| 133:23 | managed to do what the Prius never did |
| 133:26 | because he made an electric car that was |
| 133:28 | cooler than a normal car yeah it's uh |
| 133:33 | yeah it's interesting that thing of like |
| 133:34 | whenever you look at Society wherever |
| 133:36 | you're calling from in this moment we |
| 133:38 | imagine it's finished we imagine this is |
| 133:41 | the last iteration of humanity all the |
| 133:44 | technology up to now that's but that's |
| 133:46 | pretty much it right we're never going |
| 133:47 | to get Beyond this this right because |
| 133:49 | it's never going to computers don't get |
| 133:51 | better than this phones don't get better |
| 133:52 | than this we don't have better medicine |
| 133:54 | than we do today this is it we've |
| 133:56 | reached the Pinnacle right look around |
| 133:58 | it's never going to get any better we |
| 134:00 | somehow can never factor in that's never |
| 134:04 | ever been the |
| 134:05 | case but we can't in our heads we can't |
| 134:08 | get our head around the idea things are |
| 134:09 | going to get |
| 134:11 | better tell you what else I loved I |
| 134:13 | learned this term from a uh a historian |
| 134:17 | of exist potential risk so I'm big into |
| 134:19 | X risk and and and trying to avoid it |
| 134:22 | and learning about personally you're |
| 134:24 | trying to avoid it cuz that's kind of |
| 134:25 | doesn't work that way yeah it's |
| 134:27 | difficult to do yeah uh but I don't want |
| 134:29 | Humanity to go extinct and I think that |
| 134:31 | our someone write that down that's a |
| 134:33 | lovely thought efforts are placed in the |
| 134:36 | wrong direction they're placed in the |
| 134:38 | wrong place which is you know beyond |
| 134:39 | Lor's kind of like fundamentally his |
| 134:42 | thesis within human flourishing but I |
| 134:44 | think he could even spread it out |
| 134:45 | further than that this is William MLL |
| 134:48 | from the future of humanities Institute |
| 134:49 | this is Nick Bostrom and Toby odds |
| 134:51 | workor again from Oxford |
| 134:53 | uh 30,000 foot view all of our attention |
| 134:57 | is currently paid or the vast majority |
| 134:59 | of our attention in terms of existential |
| 135:00 | risks are paid on things that are not |
| 135:02 | existential risks There is almost 0% |
| 135:05 | chance that the next Thousand Years |
| 135:06 | humanity is going to be wiped out by |
| 135:09 | climate change but well I I I don't know |
| 135:12 | because I think a like what what do you |
| 135:14 | consider climate change CU you know the |
| 135:17 | super volcano know mhm if that goes that |
| 135:20 | could you know you familiar with this uh |
| 135:22 | the theory of uh I think it's called |
| 135:25 | bookas bedos blanket you ever heard of |
| 135:28 | this so it's the idea that if you put um |
| 135:31 | coal in Coal Fired you know uh power |
| 135:34 | plants into the atmosphere it's it |
| 135:37 | causes warming it's terrible we should |
| 135:39 | stop doing it but if you go high enough |
| 135:42 | with the chimney into the stratosphere |
| 135:44 | uh if you go high enough it those |
| 135:47 | particles reflect light and it cools the |
| 135:50 | Earth the Stratos the stratosphere |
| 135:53 | reflects light from the sun the sun's |
| 135:55 | the only thing heating us we cool down |
| 135:58 | it's a thermostat on the globe wow and |
| 136:01 | here's the thing here's the kicker it's |
| 136:03 | been |
| 136:04 | tried okay when katoa went off such a |
| 136:09 | huge volcano it put so much Ash into the |
| 136:11 | upper atmosphere the Earth cooled by I |
| 136:13 | think I think it was 2 degre I could be |
| 136:15 | wrong about the amount and there was no |
| 136:16 | summer in Europe the next year wow so |
| 136:20 | it's it's kind of we know we could do it |
| 136:22 | but I mean the amount of how bad does it |
| 136:24 | need to get before we do that how bad |
| 136:27 | does it need to get before we harness |
| 136:29 | the atom you know the the idea that you |
| 136:32 | go all of the existential risk of |
| 136:34 | nuclear power is there because we have |
| 136:36 | weapons but we're not really using the |
| 136:38 | power as much as we could be yeah and |
| 136:41 | that seems to be the why not take that |
| 136:43 | and people go what about safety well |
| 136:46 | okay we'll put some more safety on it |
| 136:49 | then yeah the the conversation around X |
| 136:52 | risk is what's called anthropogenic risk |
| 136:56 | so our risk human created versus natural |
| 136:59 | risk super volcanoes |
| 137:02 | asteroids Godzilla coming up from |
| 137:04 | underneath the ocean I mean the idea is |
| 137:05 | a super volcano goes off as an asteroid |
| 137:08 | lands on it plugs the hole perfect yeah |
| 137:12 | we might get |
| 137:13 | lucky we might get lucky let's just |
| 137:16 | let's try and focus on that let's try |
| 137:18 | and focus on that's your positivity |
| 137:20 | coming in again so so what's the other |
| 137:22 | ones what's the other big existential |
| 137:23 | risks so the most likely one is AI right |
| 137:26 | and this book The the original |
| 137:27 | conception by Toby Orin the precipice |
| 137:29 | was written probably about six years ago |
| 137:31 | maybe maybe four years ago so this is |
| 137:33 | before chat GPT and I'm going to guess |
| 137:34 | that he would have increased his his uh |
| 137:37 | estim AI is going to wipe us AI it's the |
| 137:39 | most likely so he says that there's |
| 137:40 | pathogens AI uh so natural pandemics |
| 137:44 | engineered pandemics AI nanotechnology |
| 137:47 | they're the big movers right we all get |
| 137:49 | turned into Grey Goo we have unaligned |
| 137:51 | ai we have an engineered pandemic from |
| 137:54 | some bastard in the lab or some gain of |
| 137:57 | function research that accidentally gets |
| 137:58 | released or we have a natural pandemic |
| 138:00 | that everybody now the reason |
| 138:02 | there very specific way that there's |
| 138:04 | wording put for existential risk it's |
| 138:07 | total unrecoverable collapse yeah right |
| 138:11 | when sorry when do I plug my show in |
| 138:13 | this because I feel like people need to |
| 138:15 | buy tickets for a comedy show at this |
| 138:16 | point in this point in the conversation |
| 138:19 | like I mean you watch more of this |
| 138:22 | but this is this is bad right so |
| 138:25 | unrecoverable yeah permanent sorry not |
| 138:27 | total permanent unrecoverable collapse |
| 138:30 | and the problem with almost everything |
| 138:32 | including nuclear weapons you'll notice |
| 138:33 | that nuclear weapons weren't in there |
| 138:35 | nuclear weapons all of them go off at |
| 138:37 | the same time it's catastrophic it's |
| 138:40 | hell on Earth but it's not permanent |
| 138:42 | unrecoverable collapse the difference |
| 138:44 | between there's a really great thought |
| 138:46 | experiment where |
| 138:48 | what is the greater difference between |
| 138:50 | 0% and 99% of humanity being killed or |
| 138:54 | between 99% and 100% being killed and |
| 138:57 | when you look at it with a long-termism |
| 138:58 | lens it's the 99 to 100 well also you're |
| 139:00 | looking at the wrong |
| 139:02 | thing you you've read the selfish Gene |
| 139:04 | you're looking at Humanity you should be |
| 139:05 | looking at DNA that's I mean listen |
| 139:08 | we're just we're just Meat Puppets |
| 139:11 | getting the stuff to the Future right |
| 139:13 | that's ay L ay lob had this idea I had |
| 139:16 | him on this dude who's looking he's |
| 139:18 | going to fire a light sail fire a laser |
| 139:21 | from the earth at a light sail and try |
| 139:23 | and Propel a craft up to about 20% the |
| 139:25 | speed of light send it towards uh Alpha |
| 139:28 | centor that's going to happen within the |
| 139:30 | next decade something like that and the |
| 139:32 | message is going to read it's just |
| 139:35 | a very thin piece of like reflective |
| 139:38 | foil I think I don't know how much does |
| 139:40 | it say help maybe send help SOS um but I |
| 139:46 | asked him do you ever think that we'll |
| 139:47 | send generation ships to other planets |
| 139:49 | do you ever think that we will have you |
| 139:51 | know all the SS um bukaki yeah well |
| 139:56 | I don't know I mean presumably the SS |
| 139:59 | inbred is going to be the name of the |
| 140:00 | ship yeah maybe it's the yeah all aboard |
| 140:04 | the SS |
| 140:06 | Norfolk they get on board |
| 140:09 | intergenerationally marrying what yeah |
| 140:12 | it's yeah his argument is the best your |
| 140:14 | half of the ship can't meet that half of |
| 140:16 | the ship for 20 Generations or we're all |
| 140:18 |  yeah yeah yeah yeah his argument |
| 140:21 | is that you get to um the best way would |
| 140:23 | be desktop DNA synthesizer attached to |
| 140:26 | one of these ships keep everything |
| 140:28 | Frozen get it over there drop it down |
| 140:31 | artificial |
| 140:32 | WBS away you go is this not okay your |
| 140:36 | worry about this is not we talked about |
| 140:38 | anxiety earlier right and anxiety if you |
| 140:41 | were going to sum it up is it's a |
| 140:43 | Restless mind and you're problem solving |
| 140:46 | for the future |
| 140:49 | because there's not enough going on now |
| 140:52 | I would argue there's quite a lot going |
| 140:54 | on now that we could nail here and that |
| 140:58 | as a byproduct of that like like the |
| 141:01 | idea of intergenerational ships |
| 141:02 | traveling at light |
| 141:04 | speed ah I don't think it gets us |
| 141:07 | anywhere I think I'd be with Eric |
| 141:10 | Weinstein on like a new physics might be |
| 141:13 | the thing that gets us somewhere and if |
| 141:14 | you think about where we were isn't |
| 141:17 | there some weird fact about from the |
| 141:19 | right Brothers to um landing on the moon |
| 141:23 | is is it 67 years or something yeah we |
| 141:28 | we've done it before although you know |
| 141:29 | how NASA did it someone told me this |
| 141:31 | recently talking about NASA went until |
| 141:33 | they put a man on the moon yeah |
| 141:34 | absolutely they put a man on the moon |
| 141:35 | how did they do |
| 141:37 | it moment when we know what the budget |
| 141:40 | was |
| 141:42 | unlimited they had an unlimited budget |
| 141:45 | you can have anything you want and any |
| 141:47 | one you |
| 141:48 | want I'll put a man on the moon with |
| 141:50 | that I |
| 141:52 | mean honestly interesting how tough |
| 141:54 | could it be unlimited uh you can have |
| 141:56 | anyone you want and it can cost anything |
| 141:58 | you want but it can't take as long as |
| 142:00 | you want as well so remember we learned |
| 142:02 | about Parkinson's law just before the |
| 142:05 | task will expand to fill the time given |
| 142:06 | for it that was not it was before dot |
| 142:10 | dot dot before the Russians yeah well it |
| 142:13 | was the that thing of like you don't |
| 142:15 | there's a great lawn Michaels quote |
| 142:16 | about Saturday Night Live but he says |
| 142:19 | the show doesn't start at 11: on a |
| 142:22 | Saturday cuz it's ready it's it goes on |
| 142:25 | because it's 11 o' on a |
| 142:27 | Saturday sometimes you got to go with |
| 142:29 | what you got right yeah the before the |
| 142:32 | Russians think of like what did we you |
| 142:34 | know Wars are great apart from war if |
| 142:36 | you could take the war bit out of War |
| 142:38 | like The Innovation that comes of it |
| 142:40 | because in those desperate times and now |
| 142:42 | you know I don't know what's going on |
| 142:43 | with the you know we're fighting these |
| 142:45 | proxy wars and the the human suffering |
| 142:48 | and the devastation you kind and for |
| 142:51 | what I can't see what happens I don't |
| 142:55 | know man I mean it's there is a degree |
| 142:58 | to which there's an |
| 142:59 | ever increasing velocity of the Spiral |
| 143:03 | of ping ponging between this thing and |
| 143:05 | the next thing and what's it going to be |
| 143:07 | and I understand why people feel |
| 143:09 | overwhelmed I I I get it too but I don't |
| 143:13 | know the last few years I've since being |
| 143:16 | around more smart people and more |
| 143:18 | hopeful |
| 143:20 | people I just I've got faith for some |
| 143:23 | reason that everything is going to be |
| 143:24 | fine I I listen that thing that we were |
| 143:27 | talking about earlier about like what's |
| 143:28 | your belief is that the truth doesn't |
| 143:31 | matter it's a useful belief very useful |
| 143:34 | belief to think that things will be okay |
| 143:37 | and that maybe in some small part way uh |
| 143:39 | some small way we could play a part in |
| 143:41 | that that would that would be huge you |
| 143:43 | know so that thing of going what what |
| 143:45 | are you going to do well if you have an |
| 143:46 | aptitude for for physics go and study |
| 143:48 | Physics or chemistry or math whatever |
| 143:50 | you're doing do more of |
| 143:54 | that you spoke earlier on about your |
| 143:56 | kids and you said about how we we |
| 144:00 | mentioned the other night I think you |
| 144:01 | identified the difference between life |
| 144:03 | on easy mode or life with low Stak this |
| 144:06 | is yeah so this was my theory on life |
| 144:08 | was I have a partner I've been with for |
| 144:09 | many many years and we get on |
| 144:12 | great and it struck me that not having |
| 144:14 | kids was like we didn't want kids and it |
| 144:16 | was living life on with a cheat on the |
| 144:20 | video game super this is super |
| 144:22 | easy why was it easy because the the |
| 144:26 | what I didn't realize you think you have |
| 144:29 | skin in the game but you don't have skin |
| 144:31 | in the game until you have kids because |
| 144:34 | it's it's a medical procedure where your |
| 144:36 | heart now lives outside your body that's |
| 144:39 | what it is you know so you go now you |
| 144:42 | you feel invested in the future and and |
| 144:45 | and and you you're more worried wor |
| 144:47 | you're worry more about your mortality |
| 144:49 | now you've got |
| 144:51 | kids because it's yeah what's the worst |
| 144:53 | that could happen you could die well now |
| 144:55 | it's much |
| 144:56 | worse there might be a saying goodbye so |
| 144:59 | I think it was I thought I was living |
| 145:01 | life on easy settings and actually I was |
| 145:03 | playing a very low stakes table and now |
| 145:05 | I feel like I'm playing in a higher |
| 145:07 | Stakes table and it's it's very joyful |
| 145:10 | is it also terrifying though you've got |
| 145:12 | this heart that lives outside of your |
| 145:13 | body yeah I think so I think I spend a |
| 145:15 | lot of time with the |
| 145:17 | um you know thinking about what could |
| 145:20 | what could happen and and anxiety you |
| 145:22 | know if I let myself there's kind of a |
| 145:25 | um there's a there's a tendency towards |
| 145:28 | counterfactuals and what what could |
| 145:30 | happen what if he what if he walks into |
| 145:32 | the road what if something awful happens |
| 145:34 | but I read that um uh the codling of the |
| 145:36 | American mind book and it really kind of |
| 145:38 | made me think yeah childhood is about |
| 145:41 | experimentation and risk and letting |
| 145:45 | kids be kids let them let them do their |
| 145:49 | thing yeah I it's interesting to think |
| 145:56 | about the |
| 145:58 | protective motivation that a lot of |
| 146:01 | people have myself included you know you |
| 146:03 | hear about this sound of Freedom film |
| 146:04 | that just came out recently and I had |
| 146:06 | one of the guys that was a part of it on |
| 146:07 | the show pleas tell me about these kids |
| 146:09 | that are being trafficked and you know |
| 146:11 | it's like a like visceral |
| 146:13 | compulsion that you have to make it stop |
| 146:16 | and to help |
| 146:17 | I didn't see I didn't see the the movie |
| 146:18 | but is that how he made his money |
| 146:22 | no yeah ruined his business God you got |
| 146:24 | really interesting guests on this show |
| 146:26 | his business and |
| 146:28 | uh there's something about that you know |
| 146:30 | this sort of desire to protect but for |
| 146:33 | me it's largely abstract right like I |
| 146:36 | know that it's an ethical thing to |
| 146:38 | protect a child right it's the same for |
| 146:41 | me it's the exact same for me as |
| 146:44 | thinking about a sister right |
| 146:47 | incest aversion for me is not an emotion |
| 146:49 | that I |
| 146:51 | have I don't I don't feel incest |
| 146:54 | aversion because your sister's fat |
| 146:56 | because I'm an only child oh right that |
| 146:58 | too yeah sure just with you but |
| 147:01 | the uh the so when people talk about |
| 147:05 | like in I can make like would you |
| 147:07 | your sister jokes all day long yeah |
| 147:09 | because for me it doesn't TR there's |
| 147:12 | nothing visceral I understand I |
| 147:14 | understand and I'm sure that if I had a |
| 147:15 | sister I wouldn't him m |
| 147:17 | but right the bare minimum um yeah okay |
| 147:22 | and it's the same I think a little bit |
| 147:25 | with this and I'm interested to work |
| 147:27 | because you you've got a good example of |
| 147:29 | long enough life without kids to then |
| 147:31 | have them do you is there like a global |
| 147:35 | cartel of parents that become extra |
| 147:38 | protective and more invested in the |
| 147:41 | well-being of all children I always |
| 147:42 | found it very annoying preh having kids |
| 147:45 | that like that kind you wouldn't |
| 147:46 | understand you gots yeah you do you're a |
| 147:48 | person in the world you don't change |
| 147:51 | entirely when you have kids it's a it's |
| 147:53 | a lovely to do and I think it um I think |
| 147:56 | there's it's kind of a final it feels |
| 147:58 | like it's another bit of growing up it's |
| 148:00 | another bit of growth where you kind of |
| 148:02 | go oh you know especially in my business |
| 148:04 | where you are a bit self-obsessed at |
| 148:06 | Show Business you go well there's |
| 148:07 | someone else to worry about now don't |
| 148:10 | you know and it's it's fun for me and I |
| 148:13 | kind of you know because you're kind of |
| 148:14 | in play mode with kids and my job is |
| 148:17 | kind of play mode it's good to Anchor |
| 148:19 | myself in that it's um yeah it's it's |
| 148:23 | joyful it really is joyful it's lovely I |
| 148:25 | mean there's a weird thing of like you |
| 148:27 | know it's it's I think parents kind of |
| 148:28 | can |
| 148:30 | sometimes they're either going you |
| 148:32 | desperately you've got to have kids oh |
| 148:33 | my God it's ruined my life and it's you |
| 148:36 | can find people in both camps and I |
| 148:38 | think again it's it's uh it's this |
| 148:41 | position they're all parents there's |
| 148:42 | some very happy parents and some not |
| 148:45 | very happy Parents and I think it's |
| 148:47 | about |
| 148:48 | expectations what did you think it was |
| 148:50 | going to be like now what's happiness |
| 148:52 | its expectations exceeded then why is |
| 148:55 | New Year's terrible why are birthdays |
| 148:57 | boring because you expecting it's going |
| 148:59 | to be the best night ever and then it |
| 149:00 | was okay or even if it is the best night |
| 149:02 | ever you go yeah well I was expecting |
| 149:03 | that and somehow crushing a Tuesday |
| 149:07 | sometimes having a great time when it |
| 149:10 | was unexpected is the most joyful thing |
| 149:12 | yeah so having kids what what do you |
| 149:15 | what do you think it was going to be |
| 149:16 | like how do you think it was going to be |
| 149:18 | so think it's going to be terrible not |
| 149:20 | even think it's going to be terrible |
| 149:21 | just like being realistic about it going |
| 149:22 | you it's going to be it's going to be |
| 149:24 | this lovely moments and you're very |
| 149:26 | present with I don't really I always |
| 149:29 | want to meditate and I never really find |
| 149:30 | the time to meditate and I'm I think I'm |
| 149:32 | terrible at it but I'm good at going on |
| 149:34 | walks and I'm good at playing with kids |
| 149:36 | you when you're with a kid playing with |
| 149:37 | a kid you're you're in the moment you're |
| 149:39 | just there there's nothing else it's |
| 149:42 | lovely yeah I |
| 149:45 | uh I think that there's a few decisions |
| 149:47 | that you can make in life Downstream |
| 149:49 | from them there it's an entire lifestyle |
| 149:52 | change so buying a dog would be one |
| 149:54 | right that especially because dogs are |
| 149:56 | usually a precursor to kids in some form |
| 149:59 | yeah F |
| 150:00 | babies and downstream from that you have |
| 150:03 | something else that you're responsible |
| 150:04 | for you need to get up at a time it |
| 150:05 | needs to be fed and watered and walked |
| 150:07 | yeah it's often my thing of the cure for |
| 150:09 | depressed friends is to encourage them |
| 150:11 | to get a dog oh hell yeah because you |
| 150:13 | might not need to get out of bed till |
| 150:15 | noon but the dog needs to poop so yeah |
| 150:17 | you you got to get up and out and put |
| 150:19 | something on and go to the shop and buy |
| 150:20 | some food and taken care of someone else |
| 150:23 | it's often like if you're having a |
| 150:25 | really tough time finding someone who's |
| 150:26 | worse off and calling them and checking |
| 150:28 | in is really valuable it's odd but it |
| 150:32 | really helps you know it's that thing of |
| 150:34 | you know if you're going through |
| 150:35 | something reach out and try and help |
| 150:37 | someone and it just puts you in a |
| 150:39 | different position with with the you |
| 150:41 | know your |
| 150:42 | problem |
| 150:44 | one trend that I see amongst some of my |
| 150:48 | friends who |
| 150:49 | are more resilient or capable is |
| 150:55 | sometimes |
| 150:57 | they allow themselves to be relied on |
| 151:00 | and allow themselves to serve others and |
| 151:02 | a lot of the time end up not being |
| 151:04 | served themselves so it's that uh |
| 151:08 | Guardian rather than dependent Dynamic |
| 151:11 | continues to just get flipped with them |
| 151:14 | always being the person that's the one |
| 151:15 | that internal critic the idea that you |
| 151:18 | sometimes the circle of compassion |
| 151:20 | you're not in the circle it's everyone |
| 151:22 | else around you and then you're not in |
| 151:24 | it and you you know you meet a lot of |
| 151:25 | people that aren't very good to |
| 151:27 | themselves very generous with everyone |
| 151:29 | else and then they're not very good to |
| 151:30 | themselves that's a strange I don't know |
| 151:33 | what's going on there but it's it's seem |
| 151:34 | is that something you ever encountered |
| 151:36 | no I'm I'm pretty good to myself I think |
| 151:39 | no it's not really a that's it's |
| 151:40 | something I had not less so now but it's |
| 151:43 | something I had um it's me it's an |
| 151:45 | interesting thing to talk about because |
| 151:46 | it strikes me that your journey will be |
| 151:49 | the worst bit will be when you've got |
| 151:51 | one |
| 151:52 | kid why you almost want twins off the |
| 151:55 | bat why because your story is an only |
| 151:58 | child that needs to connect yeah so it's |
| 152:01 | a weird thing when you have two the dark |
| 152:04 | thought you have when you have two is |
| 152:05 | well if anything happens to us at least |
| 152:07 | they got each other and you don't even |
| 152:09 | have a sister to we've established |
| 152:10 | this tried |
| 152:12 | tried |
| 152:14 | yeah yeah it's I I kind of think that's |
| 152:17 | is that not the journey though is that |
| 152:19 | not the thing of going and the the |
| 152:22 | quiet the the kind of the listening that |
| 152:26 | you've done for the first five six years |
| 152:29 | of this podcast I feel like that's going |
| 152:31 | to remain and then there'll be another |
| 152:34 | gear where you're on send yeah I feel |
| 152:37 | like that you know it's often easier to |
| 152:39 | see in other people like of what the |
| 152:41 | trajectory of their career will |
| 152:44 | be because it's like it's kind of your |
| 152:47 | you're in training to be a wise man |
| 152:50 | you're a bit Young wise man in training |
| 152:52 | but you're a bit young to be a wise man |
| 152:54 | right but that's kind of where it's I |
| 152:56 | have a friend you know David Perell |
| 152:58 | really good follow on Twitter if no one |
| 152:59 | if people aren't following him um he was |
| 153:02 | the one that wrote |
| 153:03 | the the article uh think like an athlete |
| 153:08 | which in classic Twitter fashion I |
| 153:10 | didn't read read the headline made up my |
| 153:12 | own idea about what the article was |
| 153:14 | about and then that ended up being |
| 153:15 | really form |
| 153:16 | so he didn't write an article that ended |
| 153:19 | up being very formative to me what I |
| 153:21 | ended hang on what's what's untrue but |
| 153:24 | yeah yeah yeah fig figuratively false |
| 153:26 | but literally true or the reverse yeah |
| 153:29 | so he uh first off he he was one of the |
| 153:32 | people that poked me toward turning pro |
| 153:33 | with the show what would happen if I |
| 153:35 | treated the pursuit of being a podcaster |
| 153:38 | like athletes do where I review game |
| 153:41 | tape and I get a speech coach an |
| 153:42 | addiction coach and a comedy coach and I |
| 153:44 | do improv and I go to bed on time and |
| 153:46 | I'm hydrated and I learn how the mouth |
| 153:47 | moves and all of these things what would |
| 153:49 | happen if I did that and it worked out |
| 153:50 | to be really great from one sentence |
| 153:51 | think like an athlete which wasn't the |
| 153:54 | what the article was about right |
| 153:56 | but he uh is in this great relationship |
| 153:58 | he lives in Austin and he we we had a |
| 154:01 | phone call before I even moved to Austin |
| 154:03 | you tell me this this really beautiful |
| 154:05 | sentiment you know he's worked an awful |
| 154:06 | lot throughout his 20s very successful |
| 154:10 | spent a lot of time thinking and being |
| 154:11 | around people and networking and doing |
| 154:13 | self-work and meditation and you know |
| 154:15 | he's had he got a Rabbi that he |
| 154:17 | goes and sees at 6 a.m. every Saturday |
| 154:19 | CU he wants to learn about Jewish Cannon |
| 154:21 | and he said everything I've done in my |
| 154:22 | 20s Was preparing me to be the dad that |
| 154:24 | I wanted to be you know you got this guy |
| 154:27 | who's got million dollars and million |
| 154:29 | million million people business all this |
| 154:32 | stuff and he was like yeah it's just in |
| 154:34 | service of becoming the dad that I |
| 154:36 | wanted to be and I thought that was a |
| 154:38 | really beautiful sentiment I've always |
| 154:40 | known I haven't always known that I |
| 154:42 | wanted to be a dad I always had a sense |
| 154:43 | that I wanted to be a dad and then |
| 154:45 | definitely the last five years I just I |
| 154:47 | I can't wait to be a dad so yeah it's |
| 154:50 | nice it's nice to know that even though |
| 154:53 | the kid isn't there ready for you to |
| 154:55 | bestow the hard work and the fruits of |
| 154:58 | your labor internally externally on yeah |
| 155:01 | you kind of you're kind of doing it for |
| 155:03 | them in a way yeah I could see that I |
| 155:06 | could I mean it's also that thing if you |
| 155:07 | go it's the it's the role that you want |
| 155:10 | to play and you don't know yourself yet |
| 155:15 | the interesting thing is like it's |
| 155:16 | interesting to think about getting to |
| 155:17 | know your kid CU your kid the kid |
| 155:18 | arrives and they go I haven't really met |
| 155:20 | them |
| 155:21 | yet you want you're going to meet them |
| 155:23 | at some point you know meet them and |
| 155:25 | connect with them and you know great you |
| 155:28 | and you get a sense of who they are but |
| 155:30 | it's it's bit by bit but then you |
| 155:32 | haven't had you don't have a sense of |
| 155:34 | who you are as a |
| 155:35 | dad and it's interesting what would you |
| 155:37 | be |
| 155:39 | like |
| 155:41 | fritzel yeah very good at DIY no one |
| 155:43 | talks about that I can't put a shelf |
| 155:47 | I can't put a sh up he built a house |
| 155:48 | under his house props I've heard you |
| 155:51 | talk about enjoying the passage of time |
| 155:53 | as a good synopsis well I think anything |
| 155:57 | where you're in a flow State seems to be |
| 156:00 | a magical time so what you know your |
| 156:02 | whether it's a hobby or a or your job |
| 156:05 | ideally but something where you're in a |
| 156:07 | in a flow state so good conversation is |
| 156:09 | kind of Flow State right so I'm not |
| 156:11 | quite sure how long we been talking I'm |
| 156:12 | sure listeners are going well too long |
| 156:14 | frankly but |
| 156:16 | it's you're kind of in a flow you're |
| 156:18 | you're in a flow you're enjoying it |
| 156:19 | you're not looking at the clock you're |
| 156:20 | not conscious of other things you're |
| 156:22 | just where you are yeah and focused so |
| 156:24 | on stage I find that's a flow State |
| 156:27 | playing tennis I really like I'm not |
| 156:28 | that good at tennis but I really like |
| 156:29 | playing it and that thing of like when |
| 156:31 | you're doing sports I suppose it lifts |
| 156:33 | the anxiety because the thing that we |
| 156:35 | talked about anxiety is solving future |
| 156:37 | problems ahead of time and when you're |
| 156:40 | doing something in a flow State you're |
| 156:41 | in it you're dealing with that thing |
| 156:43 | you've your conscious mind is busy and |
| 156:46 | it's just for the purpose of that as |
| 156:47 | well you know going back to the telic |
| 156:49 | and anti- telic tiic and anti- teic |
| 156:51 | stuff yeah pickle ball for me is my it's |
| 156:55 | just it's so rapid and so all consuming |
| 157:00 | that I can't I can't think about |
| 157:01 | anything else and you know so that's |
| 157:04 | switching off yeah yeah great I think |
| 157:07 | some I think you need something like |
| 157:08 | that as well something that's uh low |
| 157:11 | stakes a flow State that's low stakes in |
| 157:13 | life you you're not bothered about the |
| 157:15 | outcome oh that's interesting you're not |
| 157:17 | becoming a professional pickle ball |
| 157:19 | player you are a professional podcaster |
| 157:21 | this is a flow state but it's high |
| 157:23 | stakes this matters to you greatly but |
| 157:26 | to have something where you go it's |
| 157:28 | really just for fun I'm not trying to |
| 157:30 | get better at this like you in the gym |
| 157:33 | you're trying to achieve something |
| 157:34 | aesthetically physically healthwise |
| 157:37 | probably less healthwise and more |
| 157:38 | aesthetically in your 20s and as you get |
| 157:39 | older it be more Health but that idea of |
| 157:42 | going what's something you could enjoy |
| 157:43 | be in a flow State and it's just fun |
| 157:46 | low stakes flow state is a lovely |
| 157:49 | framework that I haven't thought about |
| 157:51 | before that a lot of people will |
| 157:55 | continue to pile high stakes onto the |
| 157:57 | thing that they choose to |
| 157:59 | do and I don't know if that fully |
| 158:03 | encapsulates the relaxation that you |
| 158:05 | have you know it may be able to drill |
| 158:08 | your focus even more you may be |
| 158:10 | completely dialed in and and very very |
| 158:12 | concerned about the |
| 158:14 | outcome but I don't know |
| 158:17 | if it achieves everything that you |
| 158:20 | could from this variety this sort of |
| 158:22 | relaxation this very sort of |
| 158:24 | parasympathetic I'm just at ease here I |
| 158:27 | lose the game of pickle ball my friend |
| 158:29 | Aaron calls me a so what like it's |
| 158:32 | you know it is what it is |
| 158:34 | yeah but his parents never loved him |
| 158:37 | anyway look how far they got in the book |
| 158:39 | of boys |
| 158:42 | names that'll |
| 158:44 | do he is currently in New York and he's |
| 158:49 | become the director of director of |
| 158:53 | physical therapy for the Aaron roders |
| 158:58 | the current best living |
| 159:01 | quarterback in all of the NFL so he |
| 159:04 | plays for the New York Jets right uh I |
| 159:06 | think and probably just easier if every |
| 159:08 | on the team's called |
| 159:10 | Aron just honestly he's not the best |
| 159:13 | he's just he's less fuss Aaron Aaron has |
| 159:16 | been hit in the head too many times he |
| 159:17 | can remember the name Aaron so we have |
| 159:20 | to hire an Aaron if you shout Aaron 50 |
| 159:23 | people turn around well the quarterback |
| 159:25 | doesn't he just sort of has to right |
| 159:28 | okay yeah yeah yeah but no he's uh he's |
| 159:30 | over there but yeah doing something |
| 159:32 | that's that's low stakes that's Flow |
| 159:33 | State I I think that that's a really |
| 159:35 | nice conception and it's like a good |
| 159:39 | justification for having Hobbies you |
| 159:42 | know yeah I mean that that we need a |
| 159:43 | justification is really speaks to our |
| 159:46 | the the activity I mean I I really |
| 159:48 | guilty of this like even when you go on |
| 159:50 | holiday you make a list of books to read |
| 159:52 | when you're away to relax like its |
| 159:55 | homework but that's you know really the |
| 159:57 | only thing I got from my education was |
| 159:59 | work ethic you know you you find what |
| 160:02 | your work ethic is when you find what |
| 160:03 | you love doing but then it's it's hard |
| 160:06 | not to replicate that in all areas of |
| 160:09 | your |
| 160:10 | life productivity Purgatory was what I |
| 160:14 | called it that even even when you're |
| 160:17 | supposed to be doing something for |
| 160:18 | leisure it's still in service of the |
| 160:21 | outcomes that you're going to get at |
| 160:22 | work so it's the walk that you take on a |
| 160:25 | morning not because you get to relax and |
| 160:27 | spend time in nature but because you |
| 160:28 | heard an Andrew huberman episode about |
| 160:30 | how it improves dopamine the |
| 160:32 | dopaminergic sees saw so you can focus |
| 160:34 | better the wonderful thing about being a |
| 160:35 | comedian I mean I could be getting a |
| 160:37 | colonoscopy and thinking well there |
| 160:38 | might be some material in this you never |
| 160:41 | know literally you never know a virtual |
| 160:44 | colonoscopy the future maybe a VR one |
| 160:47 | where they fly a tiny little Micro Drone |
| 160:49 | up |
| 160:50 | yeah that's what he told me anyway we're |
| 160:52 | in a |
| 160:54 | park what have you got coming up next |
| 160:56 | what can people expect from you I've got |
| 160:57 | a new tour I'm going to go out on the |
| 160:59 | road again I'm touring slightly |
| 161:01 | differently this time I hope it works uh |
| 161:03 | I think it will but certainly around the |
| 161:05 | UK I'm going to do two shows a night |
| 161:08 | every night Wednesday to Saturday so |
| 161:11 | work less and more than I've worked |
| 161:13 | before I'm going to do more shows but |
| 161:16 | more compacted and I'm going to do a |
| 161:17 | show at 7 and a show at 9:30 I'm a Big |
| 161:21 | Show at 7 fan by the way well it's that |
| 161:22 | thing if you either have dinner |
| 161:23 | afterwards or before you either have |
| 161:25 | drinks after or before but you go it's |
| 161:28 | not a big with an interval it's like you |
| 161:31 | pack the stuff in you know do maybe 100 |
| 161:33 | minutes got time to do 100 maybe even |
| 161:36 | two hours sort of straight through and |
| 161:39 | that's a it's a great show to hold |
| 161:40 | people for that long it's great you |
| 161:42 | don't because they break and then you |
| 161:43 | build it again and with the bigger shows |
| 161:45 | sometimes you just do it with a regular |
| 161:46 | interval but I'm you know putting that |
| 161:47 | tour on I'm working on a book at the |
| 161:49 | moment it's probably the easiest |
| 161:50 | conception of it about how to write |
| 161:52 | jokes I've had a really great run in |
| 161:55 | comedy and what am I leaving for |
| 161:59 | posterity some dick jokes right I right |
| 162:02 | lovely jokes I've done a bunch of |
| 162:04 | specials uh I'll record a new one next |
| 162:07 | month I don't know when it be out but I |
| 162:09 | want to leave something behind to the |
| 162:10 | community because it's done an awful lot |
| 162:12 | for me so I'm working on this thing and |
| 162:14 | hopefully it'll become something for you |
| 162:17 | know other comedians America you doing |
| 162:20 | America yeah doing a tour in America |
| 162:22 | sort of gigging around the place I mean |
| 162:23 | it's you know it's quite nice it's I can |
| 162:25 | play quite big rooms it turns out that |
| 162:27 | because of the one of the major benefits |
| 162:30 | of the the biggest TV channel in the |
| 162:32 | world is YouTube and no one noticed in |
| 162:35 | mainstream media no one noticed oh |
| 162:37 | that's the biggest TV channel in the |
| 162:38 | world so your Netflix and your YouTubes |
| 162:41 | the global entities mean you can play |
| 162:42 | anywhere in the world which is fantastic |
| 162:44 | I do about 40 |
| 162:46 | countries and I'll Do America and I'll |
