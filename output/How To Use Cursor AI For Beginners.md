| 00:00 | that's it submit and proceed I'm going |
| 00:04 | to show you everything you need to know |
| 00:05 | about cursor the new AI code editor as |
| 00:08 | fast as possible by the end of this |
| 00:09 | video you're going to have a complete |
| 00:11 | understanding of how to leverage cursor |
| 00:13 | as a code editing software in addition |
| 00:15 | which is probably bigger here is I'm |
| 00:17 | actually going to show you how to take |
| 00:18 | code like this and put it into a |
| 00:20 | development environment that allows us |
| 00:22 | to see the actual outputs of what the |
| 00:24 | code would look like this is super cool |
| 00:26 | is I was able to create this little |
| 00:27 | dinosaur game if you're familiar with |
| 00:29 | Google Chrome very fast watch this using |
| 00:32 | cursor like very fast it took me to do |
| 00:34 | one or two sentences of layman terms to |
| 00:37 | build out a game like this so let me |
| 00:39 | show you how from start to finish |
| 00:41 | everything you need to know about cursor |
| 00:42 | AI to start off here go ahead and just |
| 00:45 | download it it's completely free to |
| 00:46 | start pricing wise there is a free tier |
| 00:49 | $20 a month $40 a month but the best |
| 00:50 | part is that there's a free tier so you |
| 00:52 | can go to see if you even like this once |
| 00:54 | you download it you're going to go ahead |
| 00:55 | and launch in it's going to require you |
| 00:57 | to create an account with cursor for |
| 00:59 | free and on top of that ask some |
| 01:01 | prerequisite questions but once you're |
| 01:02 | launched in this is going to be your |
| 01:04 | first project let me outline a couple |
| 01:06 | things here as if you've never seen a |
| 01:08 | single line of code I'm make this as |
| 01:09 | simple as possible first major thing you |
| 01:11 | need to identify what project are we in |
| 01:14 | right now we are in the project of |
| 01:15 | cursor tutor you can see that in the |
| 01:17 | search bar here and you can see that |
| 01:18 | over here in the side tab as a side note |
| 01:20 | as well I'm probably going to do a ton |
| 01:21 | more videos on cursor cuz this was |
| 01:23 | actually a lot of fun second major thing |
| 01:24 | you need to identify is what the heck's |
| 01:26 | going on over here with this beginning |
| 01:28 | project here we are given a couple a |
| 01:29 | couple of things so if you can move over |
| 01:31 | to projects JavaScript this is your |
| 01:33 | index.js here is where we're going to |
| 01:35 | build out our environment that's going |
| 01:37 | to showcase on a web browser that you'll |
| 01:39 | see later in this video but here's all |
| 01:41 | you really need to know in the way this |
| 01:42 | code is currently structured it's very |
| 01:44 | much so where the rendering of the app |
| 01:47 | the CSS the j6 everything's kind of just |
| 01:50 | jumbled up into one file when you're |
| 01:52 | actually coding out real software you |
| 01:54 | definitely don't want to do it like this |
| 01:55 | for the purpose of this video we're |
| 01:57 | going to go ahead and leverage this file |
| 01:58 | to Showcase from start to finish to even |
| 02:00 | render this as a side note package-lock |
| 02:02 | Json this is where we install |
| 02:04 | dependencies as an example here this is |
| 02:06 | very much react based but just to give |
| 02:08 | you like more context of what a |
| 02:09 | dependency is imagine that we wanted to |
| 02:11 | integrate a payment system like stripe |
| 02:13 | that would be a dependency our |
| 02:14 | package.json is where we give relevant |
| 02:17 | script commands in order to run this and |
| 02:20 | also a bunch of other stuff when it |
| 02:21 | comes to just the underlying application |
| 02:23 | itself don't worry that do make a lot of |
| 02:24 | sense you'll learn more as we go here |
| 02:26 | and actually let me show you the first |
| 02:27 | major feature you need to know about |
| 02:28 | cursor AI which is your ability to |
| 02:30 | conversate with your code so for example |
| 02:32 | here let's say I'm looking at this code |
| 02:33 | and I'm like what the heck is going on I |
| 02:35 | can simply highlight all this and hit |
| 02:38 | command l or control L what this allows |
| 02:41 | us to do is actually conversate with the |
| 02:43 | underlying file so for example I could |
| 02:45 | say what |
| 02:48 | does copy mean and for me asking that |
| 02:51 | question what you'll see is that we can |
| 02:52 | scroll down here and it give us idea of |
| 02:54 | what this even means it helps you find |
| 02:56 | bug earlier in development process It |
| 02:57 | prepares your app for future react |
| 02:59 | features Etc so this is very specific to |
| 03:01 | the strick mode and what does strick |
| 03:03 | mode even mean I mean you can go as far |
| 03:05 | as actually asking a question on the |
| 03:06 | underlying file itself as well and for |
| 03:08 | anyone that's been coding for a while |
| 03:10 | here let me show you a really really |
| 03:11 | cool feature here so I can suit new chat |
| 03:13 | they're making some type of chat |
| 03:14 | interface here and we can actually chat |
| 03:16 | with multiple files within a project so |
| 03:18 | I hit this little add button here I |
| 03:20 | could also add you know the package.json |
| 03:22 | maybe we have a CSS file another JS file |
| 03:25 | so for example if I add the readme just |
| 03:27 | to gut check this to show you what it |
| 03:28 | could do here we only have the index.js |
| 03:31 | but we also have the readme this is all |
| 03:32 | that's in the readme so just to show you |
| 03:34 | that this works in the context of that |
| 03:36 | it's actually able to read multiple |
| 03:37 | files here I can simply say output what |
| 03:41 | is said in the read me and what is the |
| 03:46 | header text so we're looking for an |
| 03:49 | output of you know the MPI start and |
| 03:52 | then also hello world which we can see |
| 03:54 | both in the index.js and the readme if |
| 03:56 | you're like Corbin I've been developing |
| 03:58 | for 10 years this is too simple |
| 04:00 | chill out I'll do more advanced |
| 04:02 | tutorials later on on this channel for |
| 04:03 | now this is just to give you an idea if |
| 04:05 | you've never coded how to approach this |
| 04:07 | that's the chat situation there's |
| 04:08 | definitely more we can leverage there |
| 04:09 | especially in the context of larger |
| 04:11 | projects for now though let's move to |
| 04:12 | one of its bigger features here which is |
| 04:14 | code generation but before we do that |
| 04:16 | and to be honest with you this is |
| 04:17 | probably going to be the most watched |
| 04:19 | part of this video let me show you how |
| 04:20 | to actually run this so we can see Hello |
| 04:22 | World in a browser first things first do |
| 04:25 | the command line of npmi |
| 04:28 | npmi next we're going to go into the |
| 04:30 | specific directory of where all this |
| 04:32 | code is even located what you'll notice |
| 04:34 | is that that is why I referenced earlier |
| 04:36 | in this video cursor tutor this is the |
| 04:38 | name of where our code is found in but |
| 04:41 | more specifically what we care about |
| 04:42 | here is the package.json this is what's |
| 04:44 | going to allow us to build said react |
| 04:47 | app as you'll see from these scripts |
| 04:49 | here start build test eject therefore we |
| 04:51 | need to find this directory within our |
| 04:53 | computer first major thing you need to |
| 04:55 | do PDW this is going to give you the |
| 04:58 | first half of the path for what is |
| 04:59 | relevant to us all right went ahead and |
| 05:01 | enlarge this a little I already know |
| 05:02 | some of y'all we're about to put |
| 05:03 | something in the comments like Corin |
| 05:04 | this is this is too small no don't worry |
| 05:05 | your next in strength might be okay well |
| 05:08 | if that means that's my path I'm going |
| 05:09 | to go ahead and add cursor tutor to get |
| 05:11 | me to the file of where all this code |
| 05:13 | exists not so much to actually access |
| 05:16 | the path that we'll have our |
| 05:17 | package.json here is going to be the |
| 05:19 | structuring I'll make sure to leave this |
| 05:20 | in my description of this video or maybe |
| 05:22 | it will be a comment simply put in your |
| 05:25 | path that we found earlier also put |
| 05:27 | incursor tutor projects JavaScript to |
| 05:29 | clarify this what's incurring here is |
| 05:31 | that we're going to cursor tutor |
| 05:33 | projects |
| 05:34 | JavaScript and then package.json once we |
| 05:37 | have that when we put in these terminal |
| 05:40 | commands we're speaking directly to that |
| 05:42 | part of our computer obviously you |
| 05:44 | create a new project You' have to rename |
| 05:46 | this part Etc next we need to make sure |
| 05:48 | we install the react dependencies here |
| 05:50 | so we're going to do npm install react |
| 05:51 | scripts don't worry when it does that |
| 05:53 | little load bar it's not going crazy I'm |
| 05:55 | not downloading a virus maybe I am I'm |
| 05:57 | just joking but I'm going to go ahead |
| 05:58 | and not do this cuz I already did it and |
| 05:59 | let me show you how to actually launch |
| 06:00 | it now now that we have installed |
| 06:02 | everything we're in the correct |
| 06:04 | directory if you're like got to this |
| 06:05 | part of this video you're hitting erors |
| 06:07 | are you in the correct directory does it |
| 06:09 | say whatever you have plus JavaScript |
| 06:11 | does it say that no you're not in the |
| 06:13 | correct area let's go and launch this so |
| 06:15 | what we're doing here is we're running |
| 06:16 | this script right here react scripts |
| 06:18 | start when I do this your browser is |
| 06:21 | going to open up a new tab called Local |
| 06:23 | Host hit enter this is what a successful |
| 06:26 | message is going to look like boom boom |
| 06:28 | hello world let me give you some one |
| 06:29 | ones of what's even curring here so |
| 06:31 | first thing you need to understand this |
| 06:32 | is Local Host 3000 what this means is |
| 06:33 | that go ahead and search Local Host 3000 |
| 06:35 | on your computer right now it's going to |
| 06:36 | show nothing it's going to be caput |
| 06:38 | that's because this is only existing |
| 06:39 | within our environment our local |
| 06:41 | environment therefore no one in the |
| 06:42 | internet can access this only you and |
| 06:44 | your computer can access this and this |
| 06:46 | is dope and the reason this is dope is |
| 06:48 | because that means any type of edits we |
| 06:50 | do in the code will automatically |
| 06:51 | reflect here instantly instantly Corbin |
| 06:54 | Das Dash chicken command save Das D |
| 06:57 | chicken boom got it so now that you |
| 07:00 | understand how this type of environment |
| 07:01 | works I'm going do a very simple give me |
| 07:03 | some code and then I'm going to show you |
| 07:04 | how I made that dinosaur game or just |
| 07:06 | like a block game in the beginning of |
| 07:07 | this video major thing you probably seen |
| 07:09 | in all your videos this is probably why |
| 07:11 | you click this video is what you're |
| 07:12 | about to see right now so if I go ahead |
| 07:14 | and highlight all this I hit command K I |
| 07:16 | can ask it very specific directions here |
| 07:18 | let me go ahead and make this so you can |
| 07:20 | see it better better so as a very simple |
| 07:23 | starter here I'm simply going to put |
| 07:24 | this when they say lame IND dictation |
| 07:26 | they mean lame IND dictation Center |
| 07:29 | hello world could we also add a button |
| 07:31 | under it in column format saying that |
| 07:33 | was easy that was easy make it around |
| 07:34 | rectangle when I click it shows a text |
| 07:37 | saying subscribe maybe hit submit here |
| 07:39 | and you know this is where the money's |
| 07:41 | at here this is why people are starting |
| 07:43 | to use cursor a done go and accept here |
| 07:45 | if you're familiar with gits get commits |
| 07:47 | this looks very familiar shows the old |
| 07:49 | code that's getting burned deleted the |
| 07:51 | green code which is coming in hit accept |
| 07:53 | here you're like Corbin why didn't |
| 07:54 | reflect because I have to hit command |
| 07:56 | save and boom if I click this button |
| 08:00 | subscribe maybe super cool right let's |
| 08:02 | go and show you I made that dinosaur |
| 08:03 | game my name command Z here Comm man Z |
| 08:06 | again save let's go ahead and highlight |
| 08:09 | all the code again so when I was first |
| 08:11 | testing out cursor AI I wanted to go as |
| 08:13 | Layman as possible with the way I was |
| 08:15 | speaking to it I didn't want to use |
| 08:16 | developing terms I just wanted to be |
| 08:18 | like hey creade me a game and this is |
| 08:20 | basically what I asked I said okay do |
| 08:21 | you know when you can't connect to the |
| 08:22 | internet on Google Chrome it does a |
| 08:24 | dinosaur game where you jump over jump |
| 08:26 | off the cactus jump over me add that |
| 08:29 | like a s scroller game with a high score |
| 08:31 | make all the designs in a bit that's it |
| 08:34 | submit and proceed as someone that's |
| 08:38 | developing a artificial intelligence |
| 08:40 | software what I can tell you this isn't |
| 08:42 | changing the game in the sense of |
| 08:44 | full-blown application development but |
| 08:45 | it's definitely changing the game in |
| 08:47 | sense of you could really educate |
| 08:48 | yourself fast when it comes to coding |
| 08:50 | except command save and here we go right |
| 08:53 | now on the comments what score do you |
| 08:55 | think I'm about to get right now let me |
| 08:56 | make this bigger what score what score |
| 08:58 | let's go it it's a little slow it's a |
| 09:00 | little slow but that just means I'm |
| 09:02 | gonna get high let me give you high |
| 09:03 | score here I messed up regardless though |
| 09:07 | that was all done in like 10 seconds |
| 09:09 | will I have to do more videos on this |
| 09:10 | topic I think I'm inclined to make sure |
| 09:12 | to leave a like is completely free let |
| 09:14 | me know what you want to see me build |
| 09:15 | with cursor AI I'm currently building |
| 09:16 | out an entire artificial intelligence |
| 09:18 | software through just coding not using |
| 09:20 | this but if you want to learn how to |
| 09:22 | code using chat gbt check out that video |
| 09:24 | right there I'm actually going to leave |
| 09:25 | a playlist at the end here that shows |
| 09:26 | you how to develop an entire website |
| 09:28 | like actually develop entire website |
| 09:30 | that will cost you $0 a month so if |
| 09:31 | you're interested in that check it out |
| 09:33 | at the end here I do a ton of other |
| 09:34 | stuff on this channel cuz I'm going to |
| 09:35 | be honest if you already know this video |
| 09:36 | is going to get a lot of views so you |
| 09:37 | want to check me out on other stuff |
| 09:39 | check it out type in Corin Brown AI see |
| 09:41 | what's up I'll see you in the next video |
| 09:42 | these videos are based off everything |
| 09:45 | you've done up to YouTube this point |
| 09:47 | I'll leave that playlist right there for |
| 09:48 | the website that'll be a random |
| 09:51 | video doesn't look that bad I'll see you |
| 09:53 | in the next video |
