| 00:00 | here we are again hard things are hard |
| 00:02 | that's why they're hard another |
| 00:05 | episode the biggest risk to your future |
| 00:08 | isn't your competition it's the |
| 00:10 | distractions you insist on keeping in |
| 00:11 | your life rather than doing the things |
| 00:14 | you know you should be doing but aren't |
| 00:16 | people delay doing things they don't |
| 00:18 | like for longer than it takes to do |
| 00:27 | them there have been so many times in my |
| 00:29 | life where I I knew I needed to do |
| 00:31 | something and then I filled all this |
| 00:33 | extra time not doing that thing and then |
| 00:37 | the moment I did it I was like wow that |
| 00:39 | took way less time than I thought it was |
| 00:41 | going to take and not only that it took |
| 00:43 | way less time than it took me to delay |
| 00:45 | to actually get to this point and if I |
| 00:47 | had only started with just doing what I |
| 00:50 | was supposed to do I could have done |
| 00:52 | four or five other things that I was |
| 00:53 | also supposed to do by this exact same |
| 00:55 | point and so thinking about it from that |
| 00:57 | perspective I've tried to elate as much |
| 01:00 | time between I think I should do this |
| 01:02 | thing and beginning doing it and I think |
| 01:06 | you get this positive reinforcement |
| 01:07 | cycle that occurs every time you start I |
| 01:10 | call it pulling the thread it's like I |
| 01:12 | just need to start pulling the thread |
| 01:13 | and then all of a sudden what feels |
| 01:14 | really unknown becomes very tangible and |
| 01:16 | you're like oh I understand the six |
| 01:18 | problems I have to solve to do this big |
| 01:20 | thing but now I know the problems and |
| 01:22 | then it feels like you can you can wrap |
| 01:23 | your arms around it and then you can |
| 01:25 | start taking it one bite at a time the |
| 01:27 | same thing works in Reverse as well that |
| 01:29 | when you put something off it makes |
| 01:31 | putting it off more Manana Manana |
| 01:33 | Manana I used to define Power by the |
| 01:37 | distance between thoughts and |
| 01:38 | reality um |
| 01:41 | meaning if you think about somebody |
| 01:43 | who's omnipotent so if God or the god |
| 01:45 | figure would be omnipotent as he thinks |
| 01:48 | things are so there's zero space between |
| 01:50 | thoughts and reality and so if we want |
| 01:52 | to be more Godlike in our lives the |
| 01:55 | distance that we can shrink between |
| 01:57 | wanting to do something or thinking |
| 01:59 | something should be done and it being |
| 02:01 | done is a direct indication of our |
| 02:03 | personal power in our lives and so that |
| 02:06 | has helped me basically think don't be a |
| 02:09 | powerless |
| 02:11 | [ __ ] like just shrink the shrink the |
| 02:14 | Gap and I think that's why a lot of my |
| 02:16 | my little like personal hacks of waking |
| 02:18 | up and then trying to shrink the time |
| 02:20 | between when I wake up and when I start |
| 02:21 | working and shrinking the time between |
| 02:23 | one task and the next task like you |
| 02:25 | don't need to take 30 minutes of getting |
| 02:27 | ready to start working like you can just |
| 02:29 | start working because as soon as you get |
| 02:30 | into it you start pulling the thread and |
| 02:32 | you're like oh here it is and all of the |
| 02:34 | time that I was getting ready to work I |
| 02:36 | was just using up my best brain power |
| 02:38 | time on things that truly don't move the |
| 02:40 | needle at all yeah I came to call that |
| 02:42 | the productivity rain dance that you |
| 02:44 | sort of do this weird sacred ritual |
| 02:46 | beforehand and we've spoken about this |
| 02:48 | before but it's you know there are |
| 02:49 | certain things that you can do that will |
| 02:51 | make uh success or productivity or focus |
| 02:54 | more likely and better that doesn't mean |
| 02:56 | that you should disregard them that over |
| 02:58 | Reliance on them makes very fragile um |
| 03:03 | unrobust way to get into working I would |
| 03:07 | delineate the difference between |
| 03:08 | preparation and routine and so if I'm |
| 03:11 | preparing for a presentation for example |
| 03:14 | I might assemble my notes I might read |
| 03:16 | some stuff about the audience ahead of |
| 03:18 | time I might read about whoever's you |
| 03:20 | know doing the the event and learn more |
| 03:22 | about that I see that as preparation for |
| 03:25 | the thing which I still see as work and |
| 03:27 | I think some people I made a post about |
| 03:29 | preparation is like everything I put a |
| 03:32 | lot into preparation they're like oh see |
| 03:34 | you have a morning routine I was like no |
| 03:35 | no no I don't need to to you know stand |
| 03:37 | on one foot and do 17 cold plunges and |
| 03:39 | write six affirmations because none of |
| 03:41 | those things are directly related to the |
| 03:44 | work that I'm going to do and so for me |
| 03:45 | if it's basically preparation is just a |
| 03:47 | stage of the work and so if I need to |
| 03:50 | prepare to work then that's fine as long |
| 03:52 | as it's related to the work that I'm |
| 03:54 | going to be doing well we spoke about |
| 03:55 | this yesterday the difference between |
| 03:58 | focusing on inputs and focusing on |
| 04:00 | outcomes if you optimize for outcomes |
| 04:03 | the inputs are always optimized but if |
| 04:05 | you optimize for inputs you go what did |
| 04:06 | I actually get done at the end of the |
| 04:08 | day so the person that does do the |
| 04:10 | productivity reain dance and it takes |
| 04:12 | ages and everyone's done this everyone's |
| 04:14 | got a blank piece of paper in front of |
| 04:15 | them and they end up washing dishes that |
| 04:17 | they never use you know the the weirdest |
| 04:20 | tasks become alluring because of that |
| 04:22 | focusing on outcomes I so we when we |
| 04:25 | brought this up it was perfect cuz I had |
| 04:27 | a whole thing that I was wanted to talk |
| 04:28 | to about this so I'm a b big proponent |
| 04:30 | of something I call the rule of 100 and |
| 04:31 | I'm not the one who invented this but |
| 04:33 | it's basically 100 primary actions so I |
| 04:35 | talk about this within the context of |
| 04:36 | advertising so you make a 100 minutes of |
| 04:39 | content you do 100 Outreach if you're |
| 04:41 | doing outbound you do you spend $100 a |
| 04:43 | day on ads you or and if you've already |
| 04:45 | spent the money on ads then you're doing |
| 04:46 | a$1 100 minutes a day of writing ad copy |
| 04:49 | looking at other people's ads looking |
| 04:51 | for Hooks and then trying to create more |
| 04:52 | advertisements for your business and the |
| 04:54 | rule of 100 for most people takes about |
| 04:56 | 4 hours a day is and the thing is is |
| 04:59 | that that's pure inputs not output but |
| 05:02 | I've already taken the time to Define |
| 05:03 | what those inputs are that create the |
| 05:05 | outputs but later on in the book $100 |
| 05:08 | million leads um I talk about the rule |
| 05:10 | of 100 on steroids which is something |
| 05:12 | that I learned from a guy who owned 13 |
| 05:15 | or 14 really successful gyms and he |
| 05:17 | called it open to goal and he said yeah |
| 05:20 | yeah yeah he said my managers work open |
| 05:22 | to goal and I was like what does that |
| 05:23 | mean it's like so they work open until |
| 05:26 | they hit their goal and so sometimes |
| 05:29 | that means they hit their goal by noon |
| 05:30 | and they can cut out or that means that |
| 05:32 | they have to go from 5:00 a.m. until |
| 05:35 | midnight that night because that's how |
| 05:37 | long it took them to hit the goal and so |
| 05:39 | I've seen this across a lot of high |
| 05:42 | Achievers across domains so like I'll |
| 05:45 | keep shooting free shots until I hit a |
| 05:46 | 100 free free shots I will uh run until |
| 05:50 | this happens I will practice my |
| 05:53 | presentation until I do zero mess ups |
| 05:55 | right or whatever that that output is |
| 05:57 | that you want for quality or quantity |
| 05:59 | and |
| 06:00 | I think that you have to first figure |
| 06:02 | out what the input is that most closely |
| 06:06 | correlates or tracks with the output you |
| 06:08 | want and then you jam as much as you |
| 06:11 | possibly can into inputs because if I |
| 06:12 | said hey go get me 10 customers somebody |
| 06:17 | yeah exactly you freeze because it's |
| 06:18 | like what do I do and so then normally |
| 06:21 | people start they skew like Behavior |
| 06:23 | skew so it's all over the place it's |
| 06:25 | scattered it's shotguns sprays and then |
| 06:29 | they eventually figure out one thing |
| 06:30 | that works and then it's like once you |
| 06:32 | hit that then you just Jam that button |
| 06:34 | as hard as you possibly can and I think |
| 06:35 | that I've been disproportionately |
| 06:37 | successful in different domains of My |
| 06:39 | Life by ruthlessly focusing on one input |
| 06:43 | I mean even when I was a kid when I play |
| 06:45 | video games it's like if you find a a |
| 06:46 | spawn point for zombies right before the |
| 06:49 | end of the level I would just sit there |
| 06:50 | for like eight hours and just wait for |
| 06:52 | the troll to come up and just slice them |
| 06:55 | again and get my my little diamonds and |
| 06:56 | put it in and I would just do that for |
| 06:57 | hours because I was like oh I got to |
| 06:59 | level up my Avatar um but I think I play |
| 07:02 | the game of business the exact same way |
| 07:05 | Andy Groves says there are so many |
| 07:07 | people working so hard and achieving so |
| 07:10 | little and that's the lack of |
| 07:12 | correlation between inputs and outcomes |
| 07:15 | yeah I think the vast majority of |
| 07:17 | business own I'm obviously I come from |
| 07:18 | the business perspective the last vast |
| 07:20 | majority of business owners um work a |
| 07:23 | fair amount they just work on the wrong |
| 07:25 | stuff and they do it the wrong way and |
| 07:27 | so they get so little for their effort |
| 07:29 | that they wonder when they're at home |
| 07:32 | empty-handed in bed why isn't this |
| 07:35 | working when I am working but if you |
| 07:38 | define work at least the way I do which |
| 07:40 | is um output so I Define work by output |
| 07:44 | and in order to get output it's volume |
| 07:46 | times leverage so how many times you do |
| 07:48 | the thing times how much you get for |
| 07:50 | each time you do it and so that is the |
| 07:52 | do you work smart or do you work hard |
| 07:54 | it's you do both you do as many reps as |
| 07:55 | you possibly can and you are you do it |
| 07:58 | with the most leverage possible so if I |
| 08:00 | make 100 phone calls The Leverage that I |
| 08:02 | can have there would be how skilled I am |
| 08:05 | so if I make 100 calls I might get 10 |
| 08:06 | times more and so I worked more I had |
| 08:08 | more output than somebody who has less |
| 08:10 | skill but the only way you get skilled |
| 08:12 | is by doing more inputs by working more |
| 08:14 | and so it's this virtuous cycle of doing |
| 08:16 | more and getting better and then you get |
| 08:17 | more for what you do yeah magic you're |
| 08:19 | looking for is in the work you're |
| 08:20 | avoiding all the time every single time |
| 08:22 | that there is we're not making progress |
| 08:24 | in this way what is the highest pain |
| 08:26 | task that's in front of me that I've put |
| 08:27 | off the most it's always that one it |
| 08:29 | always is you know after you spend |
| 08:33 | enough time thinking about work and |
| 08:35 | deconstructing the way that you piece |
| 08:37 | your day and your life together you |
| 08:41 | sometimes believe that the answer is is |
| 08:43 | still out there and what you actually |
| 08:45 | realize is that you've already learned |
| 08:46 | it and it's like it's that quote or that |
| 08:48 | Insight or that book it's one of the |
| 08:49 | first books you read because all of the |
| 08:51 | big insights from productivity and |
| 08:52 | personal development are the lowest |
| 08:54 | hanging fruit they're the ones that are |
| 08:55 | repeated across the most books because |
| 08:57 | they're the most reliable scalable and |
| 08:58 | robust it's like I don't need to be |
| 09:00 | looking out there for most of the new |
| 09:01 | insights they're just [ __ ] that I |
| 09:03 | already learned yeah we need to be |
| 09:04 | reminded more than we need to be |
| 09:06 | taught it's one of my |
| 09:09 | favorites bad things don't come in |
| 09:11 | threes bad things happen people don't |
| 09:14 | know how to cope and they allow one bad |
| 09:16 | thing to snowball into more bad stuff |
| 09:18 | sucks the only thing worse is letting |
| 09:21 | one bad thing ruin many good things I'm |
| 09:24 | glad you found that one um that was one |
| 09:26 | on that list of things that uh you know |
| 09:28 | quotes I had gone more viral um the |
| 09:31 | amount of I think it happens more when |
| 09:34 | you're younger but you know girlfriend |
| 09:37 | breaks up with you okay then you go into |
| 09:40 | work and you sulk because you're |
| 09:41 | distracted and then you don't do the |
| 09:43 | same level of effort and you're not |
| 09:44 | enthusiastic and then all of a sudden |
| 09:46 | your work suffers and you get you get |
| 09:48 | put on a pip or you get fired and then |
| 09:50 | now you're fired and you don't have a |
| 09:52 | girlfriend and then you start gaining |
| 09:53 | weight and you stop going to the gym and |
| 09:56 | all of a sudden you're like man bad |
| 09:57 | things happen in threes it's like no bad |
| 09:59 | things happen all the time and they only |
| 10:01 | become interrelated if you let it affect |
| 10:03 | your behavior and so I think the equal |
| 10:06 | opposite of that is thinking okay this |
| 10:08 | bad thing occurred what can I do to |
| 10:09 | decrease the likelihood something else |
| 10:11 | bad occurs in the meantime and then |
| 10:13 | boiling everything down to activities or |
| 10:15 | the actions that I have to take and I |
| 10:16 | think about that actually a lot which is |
| 10:19 | how like if you think about from the |
| 10:20 | power perspective of okay something bad |
| 10:23 | happens how much will affect my behavior |
| 10:25 | well the person who is indestructible |
| 10:27 | would have something terrible happen and |
| 10:28 | then nothing thing with change and I I |
| 10:31 | love that or they get better exactly |
| 10:33 | yeah that's anti fragility right yeah |
| 10:35 | the um the Sword of Gryffindor it only |
| 10:37 | drinks in that which makes it stronger |
| 10:39 | ah [ __ ] Harry Potter reference |
| 10:41 | weren't expecting that um yeah the |
| 10:44 | people don't know how to cope thing |
| 10:46 | especially with bad stuff is um it does |
| 10:50 | explain why you end up with this weird |
| 10:52 | spiral tiny little Avalanche Pebble at |
| 10:56 | the top and then this huge sort of overe |
| 10:59 | exaggerated reaction |
| 11:06 | Downstream yeah people don't know how to |
| 11:08 | manage their |
| 11:10 | emotions I think the the more at least |
| 11:13 | for me the more I've tried to create |
| 11:15 | space between how I feel and what I do |
| 11:18 | the more consistent my outcomes have |
| 11:21 | been what do you |
| 11:23 | mean so if I need to create content and |
| 11:28 | I'm not feeling it or I'm feeling tired |
| 11:30 | or things like that the more times I |
| 11:33 | give into that excuse or that feeling |
| 11:36 | then the more superstitious I become |
| 11:38 | about doing it in the future whereas a |
| 11:42 | lot of times if I can just start when I |
| 11:44 | am tired or when something is painful |
| 11:47 | and then still execute about the same as |
| 11:50 | before I look at game tape or I look at |
| 11:52 | video or look at the content from those |
| 11:54 | sessions for example and I see that I |
| 11:57 | remember feeling terrible during the |
| 11:58 | session but can't really see anything |
| 12:00 | and I think the more times you get that |
| 12:02 | Loop going the more you can separate how |
| 12:04 | you feel and what is required and the |
| 12:07 | more times you do what is required to |
| 12:09 | get what you want the more times you get |
| 12:11 | what you want I spoke to huberman last |
| 12:14 | year I think it's called the anterior |
| 12:16 | mid singular cortex it's an area of the |
| 12:18 | bre if I've got that right [ __ ] yes |
| 12:21 | bro the best advert for neonic ever um |
| 12:26 | uh basically there is an area of the |
| 12:27 | brain that tracks when you do something |
| 12:30 | that you don't want to do and you |
| 12:32 | strengthen the connections in it by |
| 12:34 | doing things that you don't want to do |
| 12:36 | especially when you really don't want to |
| 12:37 | do them so you're hypertrophying it's |
| 12:39 | this exact sort of intuition that you've |
| 12:42 | got that some people would call it |
| 12:44 | resilience or willpower or whatever but |
| 12:46 | there's a this is uh |
| 12:47 | neurologically represented in the brain |
| 12:50 | these uh connections get stronger so I |
| 12:52 | think it's so funny um gim Bros will |
| 12:55 | need a gym analogy in order to be able |
| 12:57 | to believe that their brain changes but |
| 12:59 | it's it's really useful to think hey |
| 13:01 | you're hypertrophying this area of your |
| 13:03 | brain I snapped in Achilles I had to do |
| 13:06 | a very particular series of rehab |
| 13:08 | movements in order to grow it back this |
| 13:10 | is just the same yeah |
| 13:13 | agreed successful people this is kind of |
| 13:16 | similar to what you were talking about |
| 13:17 | bad things don't come in threes |
| 13:18 | successful people see opportunity in |
| 13:20 | every failure normal people see failure |
| 13:22 | in every opportunity both are right only |
| 13:25 | one gets |
| 13:26 | Rich yeah so I was so |
| 13:29 | this has been something I've been |
| 13:30 | thinking about a lot which is basically |
| 13:32 | the shittiness of stuff um which is when |
| 13:36 | you're growing in a business it's very |
| 13:39 | painful when you're stagnating in a |
| 13:41 | business in your plateau and you don't |
| 13:42 | know what to do it's very painful when |
| 13:45 | you're declining and you also don't know |
| 13:47 | what to do it's very painful and so that |
| 13:49 | means that all conditions of reality are |
| 13:51 | painful and so if pain is a prerequisite |
| 13:55 | for reality then it means it's just a |
| 13:57 | signal that we are alive |
| 14:00 | and so in thinking about |
| 14:02 | that rather than pain is a problem it is |
| 14:07 | a signal that I'm breathing and |
| 14:10 | then becomes irrelevant how do you |
| 14:13 | ensure that you're not suffering |
| 14:15 | unnecessarily you know pain can be a |
| 14:17 | useful signal it can tell you to move |
| 14:19 | away from certain things that are |
| 14:20 | suboptimal yeah I am I probably have |
| 14:24 | relatively contrarian views on this um |
| 14:28 | but just even the judgment on pain I |
| 14:31 | relatively |
| 14:32 | reject just |
| 14:34 | like pain is good pain is bad I mean in |
| 14:37 | the in the gym to give a gym gym example |
| 14:40 | they found that the pain that you |
| 14:42 | experience when you're going to work out |
| 14:44 | and there's a difference between like |
| 14:46 | massive joint like oh I just snapped a |
| 14:48 | muscle and like just feeling bad but |
| 14:51 | feeling bad has zero correlation to your |
| 14:53 | performance in the gym and so I remember |
| 14:56 | reading that for the Olympic you know |
| 14:58 | weight team they talked about that and I |
| 15:00 | was like oh well if it has no |
| 15:01 | correlation then it's almost irrelevant |
| 15:04 | and I can just keep living my life and |
| 15:06 | so I think the ultimate version of the |
| 15:08 | resilience that you referencing earlier |
| 15:10 | is rather than you know in the beginning |
| 15:12 | you're like I feel bad and then you |
| 15:14 | think that that should weigh on the |
| 15:15 | decision of whether you do the thing |
| 15:16 | that you're supposed to do and then you |
| 15:18 | start realizing that you can do the |
| 15:20 | thing even though you don't feel good |
| 15:21 | about it and you start hypertrophying it |
| 15:23 | but I think the ultimate version of the |
| 15:24 | hypertrophy when the muscle becomes a |
| 15:26 | tendon or it just becomes fused is when |
| 15:28 | you don't even consider how you feel |
| 15:30 | it's just not a thought you just keep |
| 15:32 | you just do |
| 15:33 | it that's that movement from sort of |
| 15:37 | type two to type one thinking you know |
| 15:39 | from it being very conscious very |
| 15:42 | effortful to it's just a reaction I get |
| 15:44 | up and I start to write right and um you |
| 15:47 | don't use up any war power no because |
| 15:49 | it's just what you do right there's uh |
| 15:51 | Rory southernland that we were talking |
| 15:53 | about yesterday um in his he's the only |
| 15:56 | guy that I've ever heard swear in a TED |
| 15:58 | Talk |
| 15:59 | and um it he gave me this idea which |
| 16:03 | she's kind of related things are not |
| 16:05 | what they are things are what we think |
| 16:08 | they are for instance you're doing a |
| 16:10 | hard workout which gives you a signature |
| 16:12 | feeling you're laid on the floor panting |
| 16:14 | heart rate at 180 sweating from |
| 16:16 | everywhere with the taste of metal in |
| 16:17 | your mouth this is oddly enjoyable but |
| 16:20 | if this exact same sensation was to |
| 16:22 | spontaneously occur in your car while |
| 16:24 | sat in traffic you'd call an ambulance |
| 16:26 | for fear that you're having a heart |
| 16:27 | attack framing is everything |
| 16:29 | Rory Sutherland says sometimes you just |
| 16:32 | want to stand in the corner and stare |
| 16:34 | out of the window the problem is when |
| 16:36 | you're not smoking and staring out of |
| 16:38 | the window you're an antisocial |
| 16:39 | friendless idiot if you stand and stare |
| 16:42 | out of the window with a cigarette |
| 16:43 | you're a [ __ ] philosopher the power |
| 16:45 | of reframing things cannot be overstated |
| 16:48 | it's significantly easier to find a way |
| 16:50 | to reframe your experiences as enjoyable |
| 16:53 | while you improve them rather than |
| 16:54 | waiting for them to be done before you |
| 16:57 | give yourself license to be happy |
| 16:59 | so a friend of mine she's a a very very |
| 17:02 | successful therapist uh and she always |
| 17:05 | asks her patients when they come to her |
| 17:07 | and say some terrible thing happened she |
| 17:09 | said what would it take for this to be |
| 17:12 | amazing and so for example lady comes |
| 17:14 | says we're getting a divorce and she |
| 17:15 | says so what would it take for this to |
| 17:16 | be amazing and so it just completely |
| 17:18 | shifts the reality of like okay how |
| 17:19 | could this be an amazing thing that |
| 17:21 | could happen to me and this is relevant |
| 17:22 | for me shifting gears because I we just |
| 17:25 | had a big tryy out inside of our company |
| 17:27 | for a presentation slot that we have an |
| 17:29 | event so we had a bunch of the leaders |
| 17:31 | in the company like the [ __ ] Hunger |
| 17:33 | Games yeah we put a cash price fight to |
| 17:34 | the death pitch folks we did no we put a |
| 17:37 | big cash prize out there oh oh yeah I |
| 17:39 | totally did that I I told I was like |
| 17:41 | I'll have no no expression just in a |
| 17:43 | toga yeah exactly and um and I could |
| 17:46 | tell that some of them were nervous and |
| 17:48 | I thought about this because you know I |
| 17:49 | speak a fair amount and I don't get a |
| 17:52 | lot of nerves in general and I have a |
| 17:53 | whole bunch of thoughts on that but um |
| 17:56 | the most basic one is that if you're |
| 17:57 | still feeling anxiety which many of them |
| 17:59 | were like hey I'm so nervous or hey I |
| 18:01 | have a lot of anxiety before going up I |
| 18:03 | thought about it and champions just |
| 18:06 | interpret anxiety as excitement and if |
| 18:09 | you're excited to go up then you're like |
| 18:10 | I'm amped versus I'm stressed but it |
| 18:13 | feels the same the way you frame it |
| 18:15 | totally changes how you feel when you're |
| 18:16 | stepping on stage um but my two sense of |
| 18:20 | if you are feeling lots of anxiety it |
| 18:22 | means you need to practice more that |
| 18:24 | just my two cents and that comes for |
| 18:26 | everything whether it's to have a |
| 18:27 | meeting or give a presentation or write |
| 18:29 | an email or do a book like if you feel |
| 18:31 | nervous before you release it then you |
| 18:34 | probably didn't work on it enough and I |
| 18:35 | think the reality is that most people to |
| 18:37 | get not anxious about whatever they're |
| 18:39 | doing you have to do it so many times |
| 18:41 | that by the last time you're doing it |
| 18:43 | you're bored of it like you don't even |
| 18:44 | want to see the thing again when you're |
| 18:46 | sick of it is the point where you'll |
| 18:48 | have no adrenal response to the stimulus |
| 18:51 | because you've seen it so many times you |
| 18:53 | could do it in your sleep because you |
| 18:55 | hate it at this point and then when you |
| 18:57 | get up you're like oh my god let's just |
| 18:59 | do this because I'm I can breathe this |
| 19:02 | over with yeah what's the gap between |
| 19:04 | your expectation of what is going to |
| 19:07 | happen yeah and the um requirement that |
| 19:11 | you need to perform right this is where |
| 19:12 | I need to be and this is how I think I'm |
| 19:14 | going to perform yeah as opposed to the |
| 19:16 | other way so I saw this firsthand when I |
| 19:18 | did the live tour last year so I did I |
| 19:21 | think 17 shows in 28 days three |
| 19:23 | continents right like proper tour like |
| 19:25 | real proper proper tour thing and um you |
| 19:28 | know I did four work in progress shows |
| 19:31 | and then that run all around UK Island |
| 19:35 | Dubai Canada US Canada again us again |
| 19:38 | and I could see because it was around |
| 19:40 | about every other day for a month and |
| 19:42 | each time that I stepped out on stage |
| 19:44 | every single time that even though I'd |
| 19:45 | done the prep I'd spent all of this time |
| 19:47 | I'd done the i' tried to you know I'm |
| 19:48 | not nervous I'm excited I'm not nervous |
| 19:50 | I'm excited um still that degraded over |
| 19:53 | time until at the end of it and this is |
| 19:55 | why comedians I think when they end up |
| 19:59 | doing really big tours one of my friends |
| 20:01 | did a 300 day tour of the same show he |
| 20:04 | said I no longer felt like a comedian I |
| 20:05 | was a performer oh yeah because he's not |
| 20:07 | stepping out on stage he is |
| 20:10 | so dialed and routinized that he's bored |
| 20:13 | while he does it and uh yeah that's how |
| 20:16 | you look at oh my God Joe Rogan just did |
| 20:20 | Netflix live to [ __ ] God knows how |
| 20:23 | many millions of people metropolitan |
| 20:25 | area of San Antonio's internet probably |
| 20:27 | went down for him to be able to get that |
| 20:28 | con ction moving and uh how could he do |
| 20:31 | that all of these people watching and |
| 20:32 | all the rest of it that set that Joe did |
| 20:35 | I have seen at the Vulcan Gas Company |
| 20:37 | downtown in Austin and I've seen it at |
| 20:39 | the mother ship in different iterations |
| 20:42 | for coming up on three years now and his |
| 20:45 | last special was six years ago that guy |
| 20:47 | has said those sentences and waited |
| 20:49 | those times and got those laughs and |
| 20:51 | understood the inflections and the the |
| 20:53 | the the little pauses he needs to |
| 20:55 | do maybe 300 times s on that one |
| 21:00 | set there's no more degrees of fre the |
| 21:04 | only thing that could go wrong is a real |
| 21:06 | Quirk mistake that's kind of to be |
| 21:08 | honest out of your control if you |
| 21:10 | misspeak a word when you're paying |
| 21:11 | attention that's not your fault uh so |
| 21:14 | yeah that's how people have unbelievable |
| 21:16 | performance ability uh and it's just a |
| 21:19 | case of stepping there sort of one |
| 21:21 | degree of competence at a time and if we |
| 21:24 | think of confidence as the percentage |
| 21:27 | likelihood what we think is going to |
| 21:29 | happen will happen as a predictive |
| 21:31 | metric then in order to be more |
| 21:33 | confident we want to have more proof |
| 21:36 | that what we think will happen will |
| 21:38 | happen and so the easiest way to do that |
| 21:39 | is to do it a lot of times and so it |
| 21:41 | would be reasonable to say that you're |
| 21:43 | confident that it will go the way you |
| 21:44 | want because it has gone the way you've |
| 21:46 | wanted so many times in a row before |
| 21:48 | I've just realized I've never thought of |
| 21:50 | this before the fact that the word |
| 21:52 | confidence is in how we describe it from |
| 21:54 | a psychological perspective and |
| 21:56 | confidence is in the interval level that |
| 21:58 | you have numerically at the same [ __ ] |
| 22:00 | word that's so funny |
| 22:04 | operationalizing what how do you become |
| 22:07 | confident do it enough times that you |
| 22:09 | feel like it is unlikely that what you |
| 22:13 | think should happen won't happen my |
| 22:15 | model of the world is accurate I'm |
| 22:18 | confident when I go up to girls well you |
| 22:20 | start going to girls and you start |
| 22:21 | tanking and then one out of 10 times it |
| 22:23 | goes well and then you do it another 10 |
| 22:25 | times and two out of 10 times goes well |
| 22:26 | and then four out of 10 times and then |
| 22:27 | eight out of 10 times and all of a |
| 22:29 | sudden you're confident because you have |
| 22:30 | a high degree of predictive power when |
| 22:32 | you say it will go this way that's such |
| 22:34 | a good reframing of confidence and the |
| 22:36 | best part is you get to use the same |
| 22:38 | word and you can boil it down to inputs |
| 22:41 | you just have to do more I've been using |
| 22:43 | my eight Sleep mattress for years and I |
| 22:45 | absolutely love it when I'm on the road |

| 22:55 | you find yourself waking up in the |

| 23:41 | checkout that's EIG ghts sleep.com slod |
| 23:45 | wisdom and modern wisdom a |
| 23:47 | checkout this is my favorite one I think |
| 23:51 | from you over the last few months you |
| 23:53 | once wanted the life you have and if you |
| 23:56 | don't like the life you have you |
| 23:58 | probably probably won't like the one you |
| 23:59 | want but don't have |
| 24:02 | either yeah this one I think about all |
| 24:04 | the time because I think about the life |
| 24:06 | that I have now and I know that I wanted |
| 24:09 | this life |
| 24:11 | but I obviously do a lot of thinking |
| 24:13 | about this type of stuff um but the |
| 24:16 | equal opposite of that is that when I |
| 24:17 | was poor I was pretty happy I was okay |
| 24:20 | with being poor and now that I am rich |
| 24:23 | I'll put quotes on that degrees |
| 24:27 | um it's it's about the same and so then |
| 24:31 | it just goes down to well then the |
| 24:33 | richness had nothing to do with the |
| 24:35 | level of contentedness which means that |
| 24:37 | my wants in past and present and future |
| 24:40 | all go into the bucket of irrelevant in |
| 24:43 | terms of their ability to affect my |
| 24:46 | perception of reality in the present and |
| 24:48 | so and thinking about that it makes my |
| 24:52 | wants have less stake today and so a lot |
| 24:56 | of anxiety that I think a lot of people |
| 24:58 | have around things that haven't happened |
| 24:59 | yet either good or bad like I hope this |
| 25:02 | speech goes well or I hope I get this |
| 25:04 | job promotion but the reality is that |
| 25:05 | once you get the job promotion you |
| 25:07 | wanted it you resettle and the negative |
| 25:09 | version of this is and you've probably |
| 25:11 | seen this stuff but when handicap people |
| 25:14 | get handicapped so they have a terrible |
| 25:16 | accident they get paralyzed or they lose |
| 25:17 | a leg or whatever there's a dip in their |
| 25:19 | subjective well-being but after 3 to six |
| 25:21 | months it typically restabilize which |
| 25:23 | means that if I didn't get paralyzed or |
| 25:25 | even if I did get paralyzed it'd be just |
| 25:27 | about as content as I am right now it's |
| 25:29 | like whatever is about to happen's |
| 25:31 | probably not as bad as that and so |
| 25:33 | that's the worst case scenario which is |
| 25:34 | nothing so okay good things aren't as |
| 25:38 | good as you think they are bad things |
| 25:39 | aren't as bad as you think they are yeah |
| 25:40 | life is life well it's the it's the |
| 25:44 | you've already achieved goals that you |
| 25:46 | said would make you happy again it's the |
| 25:48 | other side of this and you know the fact |
| 25:51 | that we take for |
| 25:53 | granted things that only in recent |
| 25:57 | memory we would have beg beged to have |
| 25:59 | had the opportunity to have been able to |
| 26:01 | have and now we're flippant about them |
| 26:03 | the new car that you thought about and |
| 26:05 | you researched for 18 months and then |
| 26:07 | you finally got it and you just curbed |
| 26:09 | the tires yesterday and you go all right |
| 26:11 | whatever and you're like you real you |
| 26:14 | spent all of this time thinking about |
| 26:15 | the house that you're going to move into |
| 26:17 | the marriage that you were going to do |
| 26:18 | the holiday you were going to take I |
| 26:20 | told you about this last time Morgan |
| 26:21 | howel steps out onto after this huge big |
| 26:24 | buildup with his kids and his wife steps |
| 26:26 | out onto the balcony of this holiday |
| 26:28 | that he'd taken and his first thought |
| 26:30 | was wow it would be so good if we could |
| 26:32 | come back here next year that was like |
| 26:34 | during the process of experiencing the |
| 26:36 | thing he was thinking about the next |
| 26:37 | thing and he caught himself and thought |
| 26:40 | okay this means that success isn't a |
| 26:45 | goal a journey or a destination when you |
| 26:48 | get it wrong it's a horizon every single |
| 26:51 | step that you take towards it it runs |
| 26:53 | one step further away |
| 26:55 | M so during my year off off that I took |
| 26:59 | after during the year of the sale when I |
| 27:01 | couldn't you couldn't I couldn't really |
| 27:02 | work on the business because you don't |
| 27:04 | want to change anything major when |
| 27:05 | you're going through a sale um but I |
| 27:07 | didn't know why if I was going to be |
| 27:09 | owning this business soon so I basically |
| 27:11 | just had to do nothing because I also |
| 27:12 | had to demonstrate that the team could |
| 27:13 | do it without me so that's still a |
| 27:15 | sellable asset so I basically just sat |
| 27:16 | there for a year that's when a lot of my |
| 27:18 | like thoughts kind of caught up from you |
| 27:20 | know when I had started years earlier |
| 27:23 | and that was when I kind of refined my |
| 27:26 | kind of theory of living for me which |
| 27:28 | was that hard work is the goal and so |
| 27:32 | it's not like work hard so that X |
| 27:35 | because as soon as you have a so that |
| 27:37 | then the x is the thing but if the goal |
| 27:40 | is to work as hard as you possibly can |
| 27:42 | then the only real output we have is who |
| 27:45 | we become along the way and so in |
| 27:48 | reframing that then it's something that |
| 27:51 | I can win or measure myself against |
| 27:53 | every day in real time throughout the |
| 27:55 | day which is how hard am I working |
| 27:58 | because that is the goal and then even I |
| 28:01 | say this just for audio but like |
| 28:03 | everything else takes care of itself |
| 28:05 | still puts the everything else as the |
| 28:07 | goal still it's just being vager but if |
| 28:09 | you just say like the only point is |
| 28:12 | working hard because I know that |
| 28:13 | whatever I'm going to get is stuff that |
| 28:15 | I will become accustomed to |
| 28:18 | and the I guess opposite of the hedonic |
| 28:21 | treadmill is like your the resilience |
| 28:23 | piece is that my ability to work hard |
| 28:25 | itself is growable and so I just need to |
| 28:30 | keep my RP my rate of perceived exertion |
| 28:33 | at 8 or 9 or 10 because I know that when |
| 28:35 | I look back on my life the days that I |
| 28:37 | loved the most were days when I had |
| 28:39 | nothing left in the tank and there's |
| 28:41 | this thing that Jesse itler has this and |
| 28:43 | I love it I hate him for having it so |
| 28:44 | [ __ ] good um but he has he taught us |
| 28:47 | who kids which is he has them they have |
| 28:49 | a little zero means that there's nothing |
| 28:51 | left in the tank and when they finish a |
| 28:53 | race or they do whatever it's like did |
| 28:55 | you leave did you leave anything in the |
| 28:56 | tank and I thought about that and the |
| 29:00 | best days of my life were once when I |
| 29:01 | had nothing left in the tank and so then |
| 29:03 | the goal becomes to empty the tank not |
| 29:06 | what where I drive but just to drive the |
| 29:09 | car as hard as I possibly can and that |
| 29:12 | means that in the beginning it's just |
| 29:14 | straightaways I'm just seeing how high I |
| 29:15 | can rev the engine but as it become more |
| 29:17 | advanced it's like all right well now |
| 29:18 | we've got turns and then it's turns and |
| 29:20 | elevation and then it's turns and |
| 29:21 | elevation without guard rails because we |
| 29:22 | have risk and so when I think about how |
| 29:25 | hard I want to work the interesting |
| 29:27 | thing about that is that the only person |
| 29:28 | who can judge you on your success is you |
| 29:30 | because you're the only one who knows |
| 29:32 | how much left in the tank you really had |
| 29:35 | and the better you get and you can |
| 29:36 | resonate with this you start winning |
| 29:40 | exteriorly and that's when people are |
| 29:41 | like it felt so empty it's because they |
| 29:43 | didn't actually work as hard as they |
| 29:45 | could have they just worked hard enough |
| 29:46 | to beat everyone else but that |
| 29:49 | discrepancy between how hard you could |
| 29:51 | have worked to to work your hardest |
| 29:54 | versus what was required in order to win |
| 29:56 | to me that's the opportunity that shift |
| 29:58 | ing towards the work being the goal |
| 30:00 | unlocks for you and I work harder now |
| 30:02 | than I did when I was poor and I think |
| 30:05 | it's because I've learned to enjoy |
| 30:08 | it how do you ensure that the hard work |
| 30:12 | Focus |
| 30:13 | doesn't detach you from outcomes and |
| 30:16 | inputs this seems like there's a little |
| 30:18 | bit of a tension with what we started |
| 30:19 | talking about in the beginning I just to |
| 30:22 | oh toally it's Direction Over speed is |
| 30:25 | the first one but we're now talking |
| 30:27 | about maximizing for Speed yeah so how |
| 30:29 | do we balance direction and speed so |
| 30:32 | with the question if the alc that we're |
| 30:34 | trying to have is being present then the |
| 30:36 | outcome actually is irrelevant because |
| 30:38 | it's about how much empty the tank if |
| 30:39 | we're talking about the signs of |
| 30:40 | achievement then the outcome the outcome |
| 30:42 | does matter obviously um and so |
| 30:45 | balancing both of those things which is |
| 30:47 | that if I want to accomplish all my |
| 30:48 | goals then I need to make sure that my |
| 30:49 | inputs are tied as closely as humanly |
| 30:51 | possible to the outcome if I want to be |
| 30:54 | satisfied it doesn't matter at all and |
| 30:56 | so I think it's marrying those two ideas |
| 30:58 | where the perfect world in my opinion |
| 31:01 | would be you work as hard as you |
| 31:03 | possibly can because you thought ahead |
| 31:04 | of time what is the input that has the |
| 31:07 | closest correlation with the outcome |
| 31:08 | that I want and then you put your |
| 31:10 | blinders on and you start |
| 31:13 | digging we don't rise to the standards |
| 31:15 | we have when others are watching we fall |
| 31:17 | to the standards we have when no one is |
| 31:19 | watching the only work that really |
| 31:21 | matters is the work that no one sees it |
| 31:24 | shows you who you really are rather than |
| 31:25 | who you say you are there's this line |
| 31:28 | that I heard David goggin say on Rogan |
| 31:32 | and I can't remember who he was saying |
| 31:34 | it to or what he said in response to but |
| 31:35 | he just said I'm David goggin's |
| 31:39 | [ __ ] and I remember him saying it and I |
| 31:42 | thought to myself |
| 31:45 | like you want to be able to say that in |
| 31:48 | the mirror to yourself and not laugh at |
| 31:53 | yourself and the only way that I can do |
| 31:55 | that is know that when no one's watching |
| 31:58 | I work harder than when they're |
| 32:01 | watching and thinking about it like that |
| 32:05 | has given me this persistent and |
| 32:07 | everpresent |
| 32:08 | scorecard or third party that's like no |
| 32:12 | one's watching which means now you have |
| 32:13 | to work because otherwise you're full of |
| 32:15 | [ __ ] and so it's this continuous |
| 32:17 | reinforcing cycle of the me and other me |
| 32:22 | holding the whip behind me to see how |
| 32:24 | much I can take but with each of the |
| 32:28 | whip that I take learning that I can |
| 32:31 | take it and continue to trudge on and so |
| 32:34 | as long as you keep going you bear |
| 32:36 | witness to yourself of what you are |
| 32:39 | capable of and I find that incredibly |
| 32:43 | satisfying in the trenches of misery |
| 32:47 | when you have to go through it you're |
| 32:49 | not full of [ __ ] I'm still here it means |
| 32:50 | that you're not full of [ __ ] what it |
| 32:52 | comes down to is I think I told you this |
| 32:55 | story about when I was with Sam last |
| 32:57 | year in La so um Sam ens used to make |
| 33:01 | content on the internet now he's very |
| 33:03 | much an operator rather than a |
| 33:04 | front-facing which is funny to think |
| 33:06 | about Sam the Creator as opposed to Sam |
| 33:08 | the operator and I asked why he'd |
| 33:10 | stopped making content and he said |
| 33:12 | because I felt like I had to start |
| 33:14 | living up to in private the things which |
| 33:15 | I was saying in public and he was |
| 33:19 | beginning to feel discordance between |
| 33:20 | the two you know he was making changes |
| 33:23 | personally but he created a brand |
| 33:26 | publicly but I think if you can get to |
| 33:28 | the stage where the public version of |
| 33:31 | you is the best version of you and then |
| 33:32 | private you has to live up to the best |
| 33:34 | version of you and then you get to do |
| 33:36 | this sort of self-reinforcing cycle |
| 33:38 | that's kind of The Virtuous version of |
| 33:40 | that which I guess is kind of similar to |
| 33:42 | what you're talking about here so I |
| 33:43 | think what we're teasing at is |
| 33:45 | authenticity and so a lot of people feel |
| 33:48 | like imposters because what they think |
| 33:50 | what they say and what they do are |
| 33:51 | completely different um but from an |
| 33:54 | operational perspective because that's |
| 33:55 | how I like to define a lot of words |
| 33:57 | which is what do I have to do to be that |
| 33:58 | right what do I have to do to be |
| 34:00 | authentic and you can describe someone |
| 34:03 | as authentic by saying how would you |
| 34:05 | behave if there was no possibility of |
| 34:08 | punishment and so if you could not be |
| 34:10 | punished at all that behavior is who you |
| 34:13 | are authentically and so in my opinion |
| 34:17 | our degrees of freedom are predicated on |
| 34:20 | how much to what extent we act as though |
| 34:23 | we could not be punished and so if what |
| 34:25 | we want to do and what we do |
| 34:29 | have no possibility of punishment that |
| 34:30 | is what we are when we are our true |
| 34:33 | selves Jimmy car talks about um nobody |
| 34:36 | throws a Coke can out of the window with |
| 34:38 | kids in the back right that means you're |
| 34:39 | a [ __ ] monster yeah it's what you do |
| 34:42 | when there's no one around your uh old |
| 34:45 | one about authenticity people are |
| 34:47 | attracted to authenticity but it's hard |
| 34:49 | to Define for me here's my best attempt |
| 34:52 | true alignment of what you think what |
| 34:54 | you say and what you do the hardest part |
| 34:57 | is realizing that our thoughts are |
| 34:58 | [ __ ] and that we have to fix them |
| 35:00 | instead of Faking the next two and it's |
| 35:02 | exactly that and I think that I actually |
| 35:04 | think Ground Zero of that is living out |
| 35:06 | your [ __ ] thoughts and then slowly try |
| 35:09 | like I think it's it's it's I think the |
| 35:13 | hardest jump is actually doing and |
| 35:15 | saying what you think when someone's |
| 35:17 | like hey what do you think about this |
| 35:18 | and you're like I wasn't paying |
| 35:20 | attention at all it's like oh wow okay |
| 35:23 | and so then you basically become because |
| 35:25 | I think if personal truth of not lying |
| 35:29 | to if you start by not lying to yourself |
| 35:32 | and then you start saying those things |
| 35:33 | then you start not lying to other people |
| 35:35 | and I think if you can decrease the the |
| 35:37 | friction between what you really think |
| 35:38 | and what you say it starts to create |
| 35:40 | some virtuous cycle outside of you that |
| 35:42 | starts to orient your behavior so that |
| 35:44 | you actually start doing what you really |
| 35:45 | think and I have integrity but in the TR |
| 35:49 | truest sense as one of my personal kind |
| 35:51 | of goals um but it's it's jarring to |
| 35:55 | people when you're just honest and like |
| 35:58 | really honest like hey what do you do |
| 36:00 | you want to go to this uh to to Sarah's |
| 36:03 | birthday party |
| 36:05 | no and they're like uh what do you mean |
| 36:08 | you busy like no I'm not busy but I |
| 36:10 | don't want to go people have a hard time |
| 36:13 | just saying no to things and I would |
| 36:16 | encourage you if you're listening to |
| 36:17 | this like try saying no to try actually |
| 36:19 | telling the truth when you don't want to |
| 36:21 | do something because we say we have so |
| 36:23 | many social niceties that we say oh I'm |
| 36:25 | really busy or it's a really bad time |
| 36:26 | right now or whatever it's um I had |
| 36:28 | somebody the other day I was with a |
| 36:29 | friend and he like I didn't notice that |
| 36:31 | I did this so sometimes it's nice to |
| 36:33 | have somebody from the outside and so |
| 36:35 | somebody came up to me we were looking |
| 36:36 | at a real estate property and someone |
| 36:38 | knew I was going to be there and so that |
| 36:40 | guy showed up unannounced or whatever |
| 36:42 | and he was like Hey man can we do a |
| 36:45 | podcast and I was like um I'm just in |
| 36:47 | town GNA hang out with Lila for the next |
| 36:49 | few days like not really trying to do |
| 36:51 | that and he asked again and he was like |
| 36:53 | hey um he like 20 minutes let's like we |
| 36:56 | can just we can just rock one out and I |
| 36:57 | was like well let me show you my |
| 36:59 | calendar and I pulled up my calendar and |
| 37:02 | it was all empty and I said see it's |
| 37:04 | there's nothing on there and I was like |
| 37:06 | and I I just want to keep it that |
| 37:08 | way and I didn't think anything of it |
| 37:11 | but apparently he left and then my |
| 37:14 | friend just start just starts crying |
| 37:16 | laughing just thinking how hilarious |
| 37:17 | he's like I can't believe you said that |
| 37:19 | you that was so boss blah and I was like |
| 37:22 | what is he talking about he's like you |
| 37:24 | just showed him your calendar that you |
| 37:25 | had nothing and you were still like |
| 37:26 | you're still not going to get any of my |
| 37:28 | time and I didn't perceive any of this |
| 37:30 | extra narrative that he added to it but |
| 37:32 | I think just being able to say no to |
| 37:35 | stuff when people ask you for it because |
| 37:37 | people ask you for stuff all the time |
| 37:37 | and it's these little these little nibs |
| 37:39 | these little tiny things hey can you do |
| 37:40 | this or hey can we show up to this thing |
| 37:42 | or hey you're supposed to or hey your |
| 37:44 | aunt did that one thing for you so |
| 37:45 | therefore you owe her um and saying like |
| 37:48 | I |
| 37:49 | don't subject myself to those rules and |
| 37:52 | I had a a New Year's resolution which I |
| 37:54 | do believe in in making resolutions like |
| 37:56 | why not um if you stick with them and so |
| 37:59 | one of my more recent ones was um there |
| 38:02 | are no such thing as social obligations |
| 38:04 | only |
| 38:06 | consequences so you have no social |
| 38:08 | obligations you have social consequences |
| 38:10 | but you don't have social |
| 38:11 | obligations and |
| 38:13 | so you have to go I don't have to go if |
| 38:17 | I don't go they what will happen as a |
| 38:20 | result it decreases the likelihood they |
| 38:21 | will invite me again which is great |
| 38:23 | because then I won't have to say no |
| 38:25 | again so this actually saves me time in |
| 38:27 | the future future and so a lot of people |
| 38:28 | don't play out the like what happens if |
| 38:30 | it's like oh more of the thing that I |
| 38:32 | would prefer which is not getting |
| 38:33 | invited to these stupid weddings or not |
| 38:35 | getting invited to these you know |
| 38:37 | christs or whatever they're called you |
| 38:38 | know bris whatever I don't bris whatever |
| 38:40 | the thing is you you probably know what |
| 38:42 | the word I'm trying to say what you're |
| 38:43 | talking yeah well kids getting |
| 38:44 | circumcised or uh I think you go watch |
| 38:47 | it like a viewing Gallery common thing |
| 38:49 | yeah is it yeah I think whatever doesn't |
| 38:53 | matter all right point |
| 38:55 | being if you say no and are honest about |
| 38:58 | why you said no people will be Jarred |
| 39:00 | but then you get this muscle when we're |
| 39:02 | talking about that muscle of being |
| 39:04 | authentic which is just saying what you |
| 39:06 | really think and I think that when you |
| 39:08 | do that you unlock a certain level of |
| 39:10 | confidence in yourself where you're like |
| 39:12 | oh I didn't die oh actually what I would |
| 39:15 | prefer to have happened happened as a |
| 39:17 | result of that oh you know what it's |
| 39:18 | Friday night and I am going to get a |
| 39:20 | good night's sleep because I do have a |
| 39:22 | clear day tomorrow and I'm going to work |
| 39:23 | my face off and I didn't have to go to |
| 39:25 | Sarah's thing and to me that's like like |
| 39:27 | over time I think I just do more and |
| 39:29 | more and more of that and it feels |
| 39:31 | better and better and better it's funny |
| 39:33 | that your friends saw that as a flex |
| 39:35 | that that it was and I I can see why and |
| 39:38 | I think I would oh my god dude like you |
| 39:39 | totally owned him with that thing like |
| 39:41 | you showed off the fact that you've got |
| 39:42 | nothing but really if we're all being |
| 39:44 | honest if we didn't want to do it that |
| 39:47 | is the truth the only reason that it |
| 39:49 | feels like a flex is that it's such a |
| 39:50 | left turn from the social mores that |
| 39:54 | people typically go through I said this |
| 39:55 | to you yesterday Dan bills Aran |
| 39:57 | superpower is his frictionless from what |
| 40:00 | he wants to his mouth say what you want |
| 40:04 | about Dan but he's lived very |
| 40:05 | unapologetically and that's what are the |
| 40:08 | things that you can get Downstream from |
| 40:09 | that I mean maybe you don't like his |
| 40:11 | values or his principles maybe you think |
| 40:13 | that he's a bad guy or maybe think he's |
| 40:14 | worth more or less money than he |
| 40:15 | actually is all of these things but what |
| 40:17 | you can't say is that you don't trust |
| 40:19 | the things that he does are not the |
| 40:21 | things that he wants to do and that |
| 40:24 | commands a level of respect that |
| 40:26 | absolutely and it should command and a |
| 40:27 | level of respect I actually think that |
| 40:30 | when you live that way people trust you |
| 40:32 | more because their ability to predict |
| 40:35 | your behavior 100% if I can't trust your |
| 40:38 | no how can I trust your yes right and I |
| 40:42 | think when people see you say no and |
| 40:45 | then later say yes your Yes means a lot |
| 40:48 | more of course because it's the same |
| 40:50 | thing Peterson talks about that a rabbit |
| 40:52 | can't be good it just has no choice to |
| 40:54 | be otherwise you you can't The Vicious |
| 40:56 | actually I think that some rabbits are a |
| 40:58 | bit like the [ __ ] so you probably can |
| 41:00 | find some that are nasty you might have |
| 41:02 | heard me say that I took my testosterone |
| 41:04 | from 495 to6 last year and one of the |
| 41:07 | supplements I took throughout that was |
| 41:09 | tonat Lai I first heard Dr Andrew human |
| 41:11 | talk about these really impressive |
| 41:12 | effects that tons of research was |
| 41:14 | showing which sounds great Until you |
| 41:16 | realize that most supplements don't |
| 41:17 | actually contain what they're |
| 41:19 | advertising msts make the only NSF |
| 41:22 | certified tonat Ali on the planet that |
| 41:24 | means they're tested so rigorously that |
| 41:26 | even Olympic athletes can use it hubman |
| 41:28 | is actually the scientific adviser for |
| 41:30 | momentus so if you've ever wondered what |
| 41:31 | supplements he would create or what he |
| 41:33 | really uses himself this is the answer |
| 41:35 | best of all there is a 30-day money back |
| 41:37 | guarantee so you can buy it completely |
| 41:39 | risk-free use it and if you do not like |
| 41:40 | it for any reason they will give you |
| 41:42 | your money back and they ship |
| 41:44 | internationally right now you can get |

| 42:03 | if you want revenge for the bad things |
| 42:05 | that have happened in your life start |
| 42:07 | with the version of you that hasn't |
| 42:09 | lived up to your |
| 42:13 | potential so I think a lot of us have |
| 42:16 | the the battle of the other self that |
| 42:18 | we're the the Lesser version of our self |
| 42:20 | that we're trying to kill every single |
| 42:21 | day and so a lot of times we have this |
| 42:25 | desire to point the blame finger exter |
| 42:27 | Al but wherever you point the finger of |
| 42:30 | blame power follows and so whoever I |
| 42:34 | blame for the life I have is the person |
| 42:35 | who I give all the power over my |
| 42:38 | existence over my circumstances and so |
| 42:41 | it hurts but if you turn the finger |
| 42:44 | inwards and you start saying huh I don't |
| 42:48 | like my life the person that I need to |
| 42:50 | punish or get back at is the real person |
| 42:53 | who got me here which is me and so you |
| 42:56 | may be right that |
| 42:57 | other people did certain things or you |
| 42:59 | got dealt a bad hand it also doesn't |
| 43:02 | matter because the only thing that you |
| 43:05 | can't control is obviously the actions |
| 43:06 | that you take and the only person who's |
| 43:09 | in control of that is you and |
| 43:13 | so the revenge porn |
| 43:18 | is thinking about what the version of |
| 43:20 | you who got you here did and then acting |
| 43:25 | in the exact opposite of that as as many |
| 43:27 | times as you possibly can and the pain |
| 43:29 | that you feel by rejecting the thing |
| 43:31 | that you used to do that got you into |
| 43:33 | this bad circumstance that's the real |
| 43:37 | revenge it's kind of like uh the stoic |
| 43:40 | Fork the dichotomy of control but it's |
| 43:43 | just taking all of that and just lumping |
| 43:45 | it all on you yeah it's it's you know I |
| 43:48 | mean this is kind of the the push back |
| 43:50 | against victimhood culture that |
| 43:51 | externalizing the Locust of control it |
| 43:53 | is the fault of the politics or the e om |
| 43:57 | or it's the state of the dollar or it's |
| 44:00 | the patriarchy or it's whatever he goes |
| 44:02 | hey |
| 44:04 | look you will get 100x a THX your |
| 44:07 | returns placing your efforts to try and |
| 44:09 | change those things on you as opposed to |
| 44:13 | on the world like you I think basically |
| 44:16 | the best way to move through the world |
| 44:18 | is to see your entire surroundings as |
| 44:22 | immutable and you as mutable you're the |
| 44:24 | only mutable thing in the entire world |
| 44:26 | you're the only anything that can change |
| 44:28 | everybody else people opinions places |
| 44:31 | economy politicians policies all of that |
| 44:34 | none of that's going to change you you |
| 44:36 | can change that's it and then maybe some |
| 44:39 | of the other stuff does and that would |
| 44:40 | be great it's a really interesting |
| 44:43 | concept so do we accept the world and |
| 44:47 | change |
| 44:48 | ourselves or do we change the world and |
| 44:51 | accept |
| 44:52 | ourselves and so it's a really |
| 44:54 | interesting dichotomy when you ask the |
| 44:56 | question because on because both of |
| 44:57 | those sound right you're like I should |
| 44:59 | accept myself and change the world but |
| 45:01 | on the other hand you're like wait no I |
| 45:04 | should accept the world and change |
| 45:06 | myself and so yeah because they're both |
| 45:09 | piy Pym PA right and so um I think all |
| 45:16 | of it come Downs comes down |
| 45:18 | to when you change yourself you will |
| 45:22 | change the world because you will change |
| 45:24 | how you see it |
| 45:28 | I think as well when it comes to |
| 45:29 | accepting yourself do you want to accept |
| 45:32 | you do you want to accept a version of |
| 45:35 | you that you shouldn't accept one that |
| 45:36 | you're not proud of one that doesn't |
| 45:38 | live up to their word one whose thoughts |
| 45:40 | actions and uh intentions aren't aligned |
| 45:43 | fly you go well I mean I I can but I |
| 45:46 | don't particularly feel good about that |
| 45:48 | that feels like the higher version of me |
| 45:50 | the potential version of me that I want |
| 45:51 | to live up to is I'm sort of derating |
| 45:54 | them that it's this isn't really the tri |
| 45:57 | to them that it should be and yeah |
| 46:00 | that's why the self-acceptance movement |
| 46:01 | that's why people feel icky about it |
| 46:02 | people feel icky about the |
| 46:03 | self-acceptance movement because they |
| 46:04 | know that people are accepting a version |
| 46:06 | of themselves which is falling short |
| 46:08 | from what it could be I would say that |
| 46:10 | they're not accepting themselves in |
| 46:13 | saying that they accept themselves so if |
| 46:16 | I say is there a version of yourself |
| 46:17 | that's better than you are right now and |
| 46:21 | most people hopefully would say yes it's |
| 46:24 | like great accept that person |
| 46:27 | and I think that to me when we talk |
| 46:29 | about the authenticity accepting |
| 46:31 | yourself is accepting the ideal that we |
| 46:33 | can live up to and that's that is what |
| 46:36 | we accept not the shitty version of that |
| 46:39 | that we are today and I think that |
| 46:41 | marries both sides of the |
| 46:43 | argument Jimmy car broke my brain with |
| 46:45 | this one everyone is jealous of what |
| 46:48 | you've got no one is jealous of how you |
| 46:51 | got it I love that quote my God people |
| 46:57 | see the trophies but not the training |
| 46:59 | ground everybody wants the view but no |
| 47:00 | one wants the climb I love |
| 47:05 | it |
| 47:07 | but the people who win love the |
| 47:10 | climb and the real mountain has no |
| 47:14 | peak and |
| 47:17 | so the view is always present the whole |
| 47:19 | way up the |
| 47:20 | climb but it seems to me to push back |
| 47:23 | there it seems to me like a lot of the |
| 47:24 | time your head down the pleasure comes |
| 47:27 | from the climb not the view for you uh |
| 47:31 | again maybe sort of uh non- typically |
| 47:35 | constructed from a psychological |
| 47:37 | perspective that was nice that was |
| 47:38 | diplomatic um uh so what would you say |
| 47:43 | and this is something that I think you |
| 47:45 | know with these episodes that we do I |
| 47:48 | often want to try and get you to push a |
| 47:51 | little bit more to adapt your ideas and |
| 47:54 | your insights for people who may |
| 47:57 | do have a little bit more of that |
| 47:59 | emotionality that comes through to try |
| 48:00 | and sort of soften this up like I |
| 48:02 | understand that people need more degrees |
| 48:03 | of freedom than me typically I |
| 48:05 | understand that people probably can't |
| 48:07 | get themselves to the level of work that |
| 48:09 | I can so do you ever sort of play with |
| 48:11 | that idea of okay what does a little bit |
| 48:14 | of view taking in look like whilst we're |
| 48:22 | climbing I think a lot of the discontent |
| 48:25 | comes from the judgment people have |
| 48:27 | about what they should or should not do |
| 48:29 | along the way and so they take my |
| 48:33 | description as prescription for what |
| 48:36 | they should do so I describe my life and |
| 48:38 | then people think I'm prescribing what |
| 48:39 | they should do and it couldn't be |
| 48:41 | further from the truth if you want to |
| 48:43 | take a break at every two steps and take |
| 48:45 | in the view do it I mean in four |
| 48:49 | generations no one will remember your |
| 48:51 | name and so enjoy the view if you feel |
| 48:54 | like it I just happen to enjoy |
| 48:58 | how much I can see that I can do that's |
| 49:01 | what I enjoy and I and I feel like I am |
| 49:03 | most present when I work and so I'm not |
| 49:08 | going to go into work life balance |
| 49:09 | whatever because we already know where |
| 49:10 | that conversation goes |
| 49:12 | but people have a harder time accepting |
| 49:16 | that someone can just work all the time |
| 49:19 | and and truly love it and I Define that |
| 49:24 | by there's nothing else I would rather |
| 49:25 | do at any time time and so for me I feel |
| 49:28 | like I ex exercise absolute freedom in |
| 49:31 | my life and freedom is reinforcing for |
| 49:35 | all species dogs cows fish humans |
| 49:39 | freedom is one of the re most positively |
| 49:41 | reinforcing thing that people have that |
| 49:43 | everyone wants Freedom everybody wants |
| 49:44 | to be able to say f you right but once |
| 49:47 | you say [ __ ] you you have to do |
| 49:48 | something because you can't just stay |
| 49:49 | stand there and saying [ __ ] you over and |
| 49:50 | over again for hours for the rest of |
| 49:51 | your life you start to do something and |
| 49:53 | that thing that you choose to do after |
| 49:54 | you do after you say thank you |
| 49:57 | is what you want to do that's an |
| 49:58 | interesting point |
| 50:00 | so there are um certain things that you |
| 50:03 | have to do to get to the point where you |
| 50:05 | don't have to do things you don't want |
| 50:06 | to do and then when you're liberated |
| 50:08 | there is a whole new challenge now |
| 50:10 | because it's a completely blank map |
| 50:12 | where you have to actually Define that |
| 50:14 | that's one of the things you know about |
| 50:16 | working for yourself there's there's a |
| 50:18 | lot of derogation about 9 to-5 and |
| 50:20 | University education and kind of the |
| 50:22 | typical track and stuff like bro I you |
| 50:25 | should be very cautious about |
| 50:28 | criticizing people that have more normal |
| 50:30 | salaried 9 to-5 jobs because I look at |
| 50:34 | most of my friends and they can't not |
| 50:36 | take their work home with them so for |
| 50:38 | certain psychological makeups who's more |
| 50:40 | free the person that actually gets to |
| 50:42 | shut their work laptop at 5:00 P p.m. in |
| 50:45 | France they've got this new policy now |
| 50:47 | where you can't uh email staff uh after |
| 50:50 | I think it's maybe 5:00 p.m. or 6 p.m. |
| 50:52 | at night in certain businesses to try |
| 50:53 | and sort of enforce this work life |
| 50:55 | balance and stuff like that uh so for |
| 50:58 | certain people you're shaking your head |
| 50:59 | what's you what have you what's your |
| 51:00 | problem I mean my first thought was well |
| 51:03 | France just took the it's irrelevant |
| 51:05 | economy and just made it less |
| 51:08 | relevant and and secondarily the person |
| 51:10 | who made that rule is someone who |
| 51:12 | fundamentally doesn't understand human |
| 51:14 | behavior so if they were to pass that |
| 51:16 | rule for me then what they did is they |
| 51:17 | actually made my life |
| 51:19 | worse this was the thing when Elon took |
| 51:21 | over Twitter so it's one of my favorite |
| 51:24 | stories over the last couple of years |
| 51:27 | Elon buys Twitter Elon finds out |
| 51:30 | that 80% of the staff base just drink |
| 51:35 | smoothies and go on hot girl walks all |
| 51:37 | day and he fires them yeah and says this |
| 51:42 | team it was him and a bunch of Asian |
| 51:44 | dudes uh selfie and he says this is the |
| 51:47 | team that's going to run Twitter now and |
| 51:49 | he put I think a job posting out maybe |
| 51:51 | on Twitter and he says I want people who |
| 51:53 | want to work harder than they ever have |
| 51:54 | on the most difficult problems in the |
| 51:55 | world and blah blah blah blah blah and |
| 51:57 | he got tons of [ __ ] for it and they said |
| 51:59 | this is a regressive policy for industry |
| 52:03 | this is taking people back to sending |
| 52:05 | kids up to chimneys and so on and so |
| 52:06 | forth and it's just a complete failure |
| 52:09 | of theory of mind that there are people |
| 52:11 | out there for whom that is the job |
| 52:14 | advert I want to work harder than I ever |
| 52:16 | have on the most difficult problems in |
| 52:19 | the world at an intensity that would |
| 52:21 | kill most people because that's where I |
| 52:24 | derive pleasure and satisfaction action |
| 52:26 | from that's the best situation that I |
| 52:28 | could hope for and trying to take your |
| 52:31 | model of well yeah but what about my |
| 52:33 | maternity leave and yeah but what about |
| 52:34 | you know jeans Fridays and yeah but what |
| 52:36 | about you know hot girl walks all of |
| 52:39 | that is those are things that people |
| 52:41 | don't want adding those in gets in the |
| 52:43 | way of the thing that they do |
| 52:51 | want I think a lot of the confusion |
| 52:53 | around the people who are wanting to |
| 52:55 | work harder than they are or don't like |
| 52:58 | that I work hard or that you work hard |
| 53:01 | think that they they take this statement |
| 53:05 | as a judgment or criticism on how they |
| 53:07 | live their life and it's because on the |
| 53:09 | other side of that free line you're like |
| 53:11 | okay I'm now free I have a blank slate |
| 53:13 | if I do something or you do something |
| 53:16 | that they deem painful for them now or |
| 53:19 | something that they don't enjoy they |
| 53:21 | then say you are suffering and that is |
| 53:24 | bad and both of those things I reject |
| 53:27 | wholeheartedly first you don't know that |
| 53:29 | I'm suffering because you have no idea |
| 53:31 | what's going on inside of me come and |
| 53:34 | also what does your judgment mean at all |
| 53:36 | to |
| 53:37 | me there's a Tim Cook internal memo that |
| 53:42 | he sent there's a saying that if you do |
| 53:44 | what you love you will never work a day |
| 53:46 | in your life at Apple I learned that is |
| 53:49 | a total Croc you will work harder than |
| 53:52 | you ever thought possible but the tools |
| 53:54 | will feel light in your hands |
| 53:58 | so |
| 53:59 | good chef's kiss chef's kiss Tim |
| 54:06 | Cook feel like you crushed that |
| 54:10 | one I have a friend who worked for a |
| 54:14 | very highlevel uh recruitment company SE |
| 54:17 | Suite XX for the biggest companies on |
| 54:19 | the planet I don't know whether it was |
| 54:22 | some internal internet thing or whether |
| 54:24 | they actually saw these people or they |
| 54:26 | maybe candidates with other companies |
| 54:28 | but he was able to see the breakdown |
| 54:31 | interviews with some of the best CEOs in |
| 54:34 | the world so he was able to see the |
| 54:36 | summary of Tim Cook and Susanna was juky |
| 54:43 | the lady uh and apparently the first |
| 54:46 | line so these guys are seeing everybody |
| 54:48 | the best on the planet right and I was |
| 54:50 | like okay so just explain to me the |
| 54:53 | interpretation difference between the |
| 54:55 | guys that are already AAA and then Tim |
| 54:59 | Cook and he said the first line of Tim |
| 55:03 | Cook's summary just said Rockstar that |
| 55:06 | was the first thing all it said was |
| 55:08 | Rockstar and he realized that in a pool |
| 55:11 | of the best Executives on the planet |
| 55:15 | people like Tim and people like Susanna |
| 55:17 | still are heads and shoulders Above the |
| 55:19 | Rest I just thought that was so cool to |
| 55:21 | like see these people in their nent |
| 55:24 | stage before they've got the thing that |
| 55:26 | they're going going to really magnify |
| 55:28 | they had all the attributes they didn't |
| 55:29 | have the proof yet yeah they didn't have |
| 55:31 | the playground they didn't have the |
| 55:32 | petri dish to be able to show just how |
| 55:34 | much they could multiply it yeah which I |
| 55:37 | think about that a lot when it comes to |
| 55:39 | kind of like potential energy versus |
| 55:41 | reality for people on their way up and |
| 55:43 | so there's this huge time delay between |
| 55:47 | when we start behaving in a way that a |
| 55:49 | winner behaves and when we start winning |
| 55:52 | and the problem is that the bigger the |
| 55:55 | mountain you're trying to climb the |
| 55:56 | bigger the W you're trying to get |
| 55:58 | typically the more delayed it is yeah |
| 56:01 | between when you start behaving like a |
| 56:03 | winner and when you start being a winner |
| 56:05 | and most people don't get the fast |
| 56:08 | enough feedback loop to know that |
| 56:10 | they're on the right path when they are |
| 56:13 | taking these first steps in the right |
| 56:14 | direction because they have this really |
| 56:17 | big goal but they forget that with that |
| 56:20 | really big goal comes the even longer |
| 56:22 | delay that it takes to get there while |
| 56:25 | still continuing to act with no feedback |
| 56:28 | from society positive reinforcement |
| 56:31 | whatsoever and I think that's like if I |
| 56:34 | actually had to put a real like what's |
| 56:36 | what's been what has worked so well for |
| 56:38 | me and why the input over the output |
| 56:41 | Focus has been so powerful is that I can |
| 56:44 | extend the time RIS in basically |
| 56:46 | indefinitely because the goal is me and |
| 56:49 | then the external goals occur you don't |
| 56:51 | need the positive reinforcement I mean |
| 56:53 | everybody's seen it I need the positive |
| 56:55 | reinforcement but the the positive |
| 56:56 | reinforcement is coming from me |
| 56:57 | interally I'm just being like just just |
| 56:59 | because I think it's important the |
| 57:00 | positive external reinforcement that |
| 57:02 | most people are looking for right but if |
| 57:03 | you if you are the goal then the actions |
| 57:06 | you take every day are reinforcing who |
| 57:08 | you believe yourself to be that's where |
| 57:09 | the confidence comes from as long as the |
| 57:11 | directionally correct and if you just |
| 57:13 | want to be satisfied then just work your |
| 57:14 | ass |
| 57:16 | off uh yeah I mean everybody's seen one |
| 57:18 | of those exponential graphs and I I one |
| 57:22 | of my good friends George bought me uh |
| 57:24 | at Professor um |
| 57:26 | he's great he's [ __ ] fantastic I I |
| 57:29 | found I'll tell you once Ro [ __ ] he |
| 57:31 | won't let me say it um but he's just got |
| 57:33 | the most insane client uh like one of |
| 57:36 | the coolest companies on the planet um |
| 57:38 | he bought me for a gift last year it's |
| 57:43 | uh the 1 million subscriber announcement |
| 57:48 | post that I did uh it's the first ever |
| 57:51 | test footage episode I did in |
| 57:53 | 2017 and in the middle is the play graph |
| 57:57 | that goes between the two and you look |
| 58:00 | and it is up until a year at the time up |
| 58:04 | until like a year before it's flat |
| 58:06 | there's nothing there was days I |
| 58:07 | remember looking back there was days |
| 58:09 | when we were doing this show in March |
| 58:13 | April and May of 2018 where we did zero |
| 58:16 | plays we'd already launched I was |
| 58:18 | releasing an episode a week and there |
| 58:20 | was days where we did no plays and I |
| 58:22 | released an episode and we did no plays |
| 58:24 | I went back through and looked I don't |
| 58:25 | think I even told you this this I |
| 58:27 | messaged every single one of the |
| 58:29 | Thousand contacts in my phone that I'd |
| 58:31 | accumulated from nightlife promo on |
| 58:33 | WhatsApp saying hi I've just launched a |
| 58:35 | podcast would you mind subscribing to me |
| 58:38 | a thousand different people bunched into |
| 58:40 | 50 person broadcast lists because that |
| 58:42 | was the maximum broadcast list you used |
| 58:43 | to be able to do and I was the most |
| 58:46 | ground floor door-to-door sales to try |
| 58:49 | and accumulate an audience and it just |
| 58:51 | keeps happening there's no presuming |
| 58:53 | that you keep on going exponentially it |
| 58:55 | makes every previous version poultry and |
| 58:59 | uh yeah being able to continue doing |
| 59:02 | something without seeing the results of |
| 59:05 | your work is one of the best competitive |
| 59:07 | advantages |
| 59:09 | because everybody else is feeling the |
| 59:11 | same discomfort that you are everybody |
| 59:13 | else is going I don't know if this is |
| 59:15 | going to work and this is hard and why |
| 59:17 | is no one telling me that I'm doing a |
| 59:18 | good job and [ __ ] another day with no |
| 59:20 | plays that's |
| 59:22 | stupid and then you end up looking at |
| 59:26 | the top 100 podcasts in the |
| 59:30 | world I think account for |
| 59:32 | 80% of the global plays 100 shows out of |
| 59:37 | about 4 million account for 80% of the |
| 59:40 | plays which means there's what |
| 59:44 | 399,900 |
| 59:47 | 9 [ __ ] that has got the entire rest |
| 59:51 | of it that's 20% for those that's |
| 59:54 | it the leading indic at of a successful |
| 59:57 | person is the ability to act without |
| 59:59 | anything |
| 60:01 | happening and when you continue down |
| 60:03 | that path it happens slower than you |
| 60:06 | expect and then faster than you can |
| 60:08 | imagine and I think that's the part that |
| 60:10 | everyone misses is they expect the |
| 60:11 | faster than they can imagine and they |
| 60:12 | imagine really big and so then their |
| 60:14 | expectations are really big really fast |
| 60:16 | but they they take the intensity and |
| 60:19 | they don't apply it to a timeline that's |
| 60:21 | appropriate in other news this episode |

| 61:17 | that's drink LM nt.com |
| 61:21 | slash modern wisdom this is from Mark |
| 61:24 | Manson why I hate being around negative |
| 61:26 | people being an [ __ ] is a weak |
| 61:29 | person's idea of strength complaining is |
| 61:31 | their connection never let yourself be |
| 61:33 | held back by other people's fears people |
| 61:36 | criticize what they were afraid to do |
| 61:37 | themselves because bold action reminds |
| 61:40 | them of their own inaction if you're |
| 61:42 | afraid to be criticized why do you care |
| 61:44 | about the opinions of those who are too |
| 61:46 | timid to do it themselves if you are the |
| 61:49 | criticizer does tearing down someone who |
| 61:51 | has the courage you lack make you better |
| 62:03 | yeah people criticize because it helps |
| 62:05 | them justify the risks they chose not to |
| 62:09 | take in the hopes that it'll dissuade |
| 62:11 | you from doing it so that you can be in |
| 62:12 | the exact same position as them which |
| 62:14 | then justifies that they made the right |
| 62:16 | call this happened when I stopped |
| 62:18 | drinking uh you know it was now going |
| 62:21 | low and no on alcohol is kind of invogue |
| 62:23 | and super duper common but as a club |
| 62:26 | promoter in whatever 2015 2016 that was |
| 62:29 | pretty rare and um I think a lot of the |
| 62:33 | pushback that I got from the people |
| 62:35 | around me some of the people around me |
| 62:38 | was your behavior is throwing my |
| 62:40 | behavior into sharp contrast and you |
| 62:43 | know this is the lonely chapter right |
| 62:45 | this is why the movement away from your |
| 62:47 | existing friend group this is Neo you've |
| 62:49 | already been down that road you know |
| 62:51 | where it leads you know you don't want |
| 62:52 | to go there it's all of those things but |
| 62:58 | because at least for me I always have |
| 63:01 | such inherent uncertainty of my own |
| 63:06 | opinions and such uh a sense that |
| 63:09 | everybody else is balanced and actually |
| 63:11 | knows what they're doing that I give |
| 63:14 | undue weight to the criticisms of others |
| 63:17 | oh maybe they are right maybe it is |
| 63:18 | stupid for me to stop drinking maybe |
| 63:20 | this does make me boring maybe it is |
| 63:22 | pointless for me to do like who even |
| 63:24 | knows if meditation Works [ __ ] Sam |
| 63:25 | Harris right like you know all of these |
| 63:28 | doubts that start to creep in and that |
| 63:31 | like we were saying before this is the |
| 63:33 | discomfort that everybody feels whether |
| 63:34 | you're launching a business or doing |
| 63:36 | personal development or doing all the |
| 63:37 | rest of it and as opposed to thinking |
| 63:40 | about it as a bug think about it as a |
| 63:42 | feature and as opposed to thinking about |
| 63:44 | it |
| 63:49 | as |
| 63:51 | something that's a personal curse that's |
| 63:54 | difficult think about it as the |
| 63:55 | selection criteria that everybody has to |
| 63:58 | get over that's the reason why so few |
| 64:00 | people are equanimous and actually have |
| 64:02 | peace in their mind because meditation |
| 64:05 | is hard and everyone thinks am I doing |
| 64:06 | it right this kind of sucks and I'm |
| 64:08 | Twitchy and I'm tired today why is so |
| 64:09 | few people in in shape because going to |
| 64:12 | the gym and sticking to the gym is |
| 64:13 | difficult maybe it's a tiny bit easier |
| 64:15 | for some people that like it than others |
| 64:17 | but for most people most of the time |
| 64:19 | it's really really hard thinking about |
| 64:22 | the challenges that you need to face |
| 64:24 | it's just a selection C the cost of |
| 64:25 | doing business right this is just the |
| 64:28 | cost of doing business and I need to pay |
| 64:34 | it it's rarely the information or the |
| 64:39 | intensity that makes things hard it's |
| 64:43 | the sticking with it that makes it hard |
| 64:46 | and so the desire that we have to quit |
| 64:51 | is simply breaking the consistency and |
| 64:55 | and so that's why consistency has always |
| 64:56 | been the hardest thing for most people |
| 64:58 | to achieve but the intensity of what you |
| 65:00 | have to do to be successful is much |
| 65:02 | lower than most people expect and so |
| 65:04 | oftentimes they suffer significantly |
| 65:05 | more in a short period of time than is |
| 65:08 | required to be successful over a much |
| 65:10 | longer period of time with a much lower |
| 65:11 | intensity and so it's just like if you |
| 65:13 | walk for five minutes a day you're going |
| 65:15 | to get you know 50% of the health |
| 65:17 | benefits probably more than that I'm |
| 65:19 | sure um of just even exercising you add |
| 65:21 | 10 years to your life if you walked five |
| 65:23 | or 10 minutes a day um |
| 65:27 | and the path of personal development |
| 65:32 | is befriending uncertainty and so I |
| 65:36 | obviously sit from the entrepreneurial |
| 65:37 | perspective but almost all decisions |
| 65:40 | that you make in the beginning you have |
| 65:41 | incomplete data and you have to make |
| 65:42 | decisions anyways and so it's growing |
| 65:45 | comfortable with taking your best bad |
| 65:47 | guess and being directionally correct |
| 65:50 | rather than searching for a perfect |
| 65:51 | answer because a perfect answer assumes |
| 65:54 | perfect information which you can only |
| 65:56 | have after you begin and so in some ways |
| 66:00 | making a decision is the perfect answer |
| 66:03 | so that you can get the information feed |
| 66:06 | to then improve the quality of the |
| 66:07 | decision later and I think that one Loop |
| 66:09 | is what a lot of people miss out on is |
| 66:11 | they spend they obsess for years |
| 66:14 | sometimes on the perfect pick the |
| 66:15 | perfect business the perfect job the |
| 66:17 | Perfect Mate when most of the times |
| 66:21 | beginning each step illuminates the next |
| 66:25 | step which means the information the |
| 66:27 | feedback that you get from walking gives |
| 66:29 | you more about where to walk than trying |
| 66:32 | to sit at the beginning in the darkness |
| 66:34 | and pick a direction well it's the |
| 66:36 | difference as well I think between |
| 66:38 | people who are super Advanced super |
| 66:39 | developed super far down the line and |
| 66:41 | people who are beginning it's like dude |
| 66:43 | what have you got to what are you |
| 66:43 | risking by trying to do this thing |
| 66:46 | you've you for you it's fine for you to |
| 66:49 | spend 18 months negotiating with Sam on |
| 66:52 | the school deal but if you are yet to do |
| 66:56 | any business that's probably not |
| 66:58 | necessarily the right way to go about |
| 67:00 | things uh Tim Ferris says in the short |
| 67:03 | term your success depends on your |
| 67:05 | intensity in the long term your success |
| 67:07 | depends on your consistency do not |
| 67:10 | sacrifice the latter for the |
| 67:11 | former what's wild |
| 67:14 | about the fear that people have when |
| 67:16 | they're starting out is that they say |
| 67:19 | things like I have nothing going for me |
| 67:21 | I have no advantages I have nothing to |
| 67:24 | my name I have no money I have have no |
| 67:25 | network I have no resources but using |
| 67:28 | Rory Sutherlands reframing it also means |
| 67:31 | that you have nothing to lose which |
| 67:33 | makes you incredibly dangerous and I |
| 67:36 | think people wildly |
| 67:37 | underestimate how many shots on goal you |
| 67:40 | can take when you have nothing to lose |
| 67:42 | whereas when someone has something to |
| 67:43 | lose they have to be more and more |
| 67:44 | selective about the the shots they take |
| 67:46 | and so you have the perfect conditions |
| 67:49 | for taking risk because the worst case |
| 67:51 | scenario is Baseline is where you're |
| 67:52 | currently at correct yeah and so that |
| 67:55 | means side is this which means that it's |
| 67:57 | like going to the casino and playing |
| 68:00 | craps but they say that you can just |
| 68:02 | keep playing until you win but people |
| 68:04 | are afraid to |
| 68:07 | roll reminder for anyone internally |
| 68:09 | debating weekend plans if you don't want |
| 68:11 | to go don't go if they care whether you |
| 68:15 | go or not they don't care about you and |
| 68:18 | if they care about you they don't care |
| 68:20 | if you go or not just because you have |
| 68:22 | free time doesn't mean anyone who asks |
| 68:24 | for it isn't title to |
| 68:30 | it I think the F the second part I want |
| 68:33 | to start with which |
| 68:35 | is if you see that you have an empty |
| 68:38 | calendar most people assume that if |
| 68:41 | someone asks you for that time it's |
| 68:43 | therefore |
| 68:44 | theirs and it's only not theirs when |
| 68:47 | someone else has claimed it |
| 68:50 | which means that your time only belongs |
| 68:55 | bels to other people and then you're |
| 68:58 | surprised by the fact that your |
| 69:00 | investment of time has yielded nothing |
| 69:02 | for you when you've given the only and |
| 69:04 | most valuable asset that you have to |
| 69:06 | everyone else who often give a very poor |
| 69:10 | return on it for you and so in the |
| 69:13 | beginning if you don't have money the |
| 69:14 | only thing you have is time and so that |
| 69:17 | is the only thing that you it's the only |
| 69:19 | currency you can spend to improve |
| 69:20 | yourself or get closer to your goals and |
| 69:22 | so if that's the one currency you have |
| 69:25 | then why on Earth would you give it |
| 69:29 | away I think it's genuinely right to say |
| 69:33 | that your calendar is a better measure |
| 69:35 | of your wealth than your bank |
| 69:37 | account it's also the easiest way to |
| 69:39 | know where someone's going to be in five |
| 69:40 | years or even a year how so you just see |
| 69:43 | what they're where they're investing |
| 69:45 | their time and you can predict like more |
| 69:48 | accurately what their life is going to |
| 69:50 | look like in a year based on what |
| 69:51 | they're doing today and it's a good |
| 69:52 | thing you know for us from it's hard for |
| 69:55 | me not to put the business stuff into it |
| 69:56 | but a reminder that the life that I'm |
| 70:00 | living today is a result of the work |
| 70:02 | that I did 6 and 12 months ago and so if |
| 70:04 | you to look at my calendar 6 and 12 |
| 70:06 | months ago then you might extrapolate |
| 70:07 | out to what I'm doing today but just |
| 70:09 | like people want the immediate reward |
| 70:12 | they also see their current condition as |
| 70:14 | a result of the behavior they're doing |
| 70:16 | today it's not at all and so that's why |
| 70:20 | I think having in some ways a very vivid |
| 70:22 | imagination of like this is where I |
| 70:24 | think the |
| 70:25 | the benefit of quote visualization comes |
| 70:27 | into play I don't see it as much as a |
| 70:29 | benefit for like oh I have to imagine |
| 70:31 | this thing to happen but I think it's |
| 70:32 | more powerful to think I'm doing this |
| 70:34 | thing today and I'm imagining it |
| 70:36 | happening so it's an approximation of |
| 70:38 | the feedback loop that you want to have |
| 70:40 | and so it helps you substitute and get |
| 70:42 | through the period where nothing's |
| 70:43 | actually happening this |
| 70:45 | is it was so cool to learn |
| 70:49 | this going to the gym is one of the very |
| 70:52 | few Pursuits that you can do where |
| 70:56 | in the act of doing the thing you get a |
| 70:58 | brief window into what it will be like |
| 71:00 | if you continue to do the thing if I go |
| 71:03 | on Dual lingo and try to learn Spanish I |
| 71:07 | don't briefly become much better at |
| 71:10 | Spanish like where I'm going to be at in |
| 71:13 | 6 months or 12 months time but if I go |
| 71:15 | to the gym and get a pump on I go hey |
| 71:17 | that's me hopefully flat in 9 months |
| 71:21 | time like how I look now at the end of |
| 71:23 | the session is where I want to be toward |
| 71:25 | the end of this year and that |
| 71:28 | reinforcement Loop is so good I think I |
| 71:30 | genuinely no one's spoken about this the |
| 71:32 | pump preview yeah but like that I think |
| 71:35 | is the feedback mechanism that makes the |
| 71:38 | gym so compelling it's one of the |
| 71:39 | reasons why it makes the gym so |
| 71:40 | compelling you get this brief window |
| 71:42 | into a future version of you and you go |
| 71:44 | [ __ ] dude I look so my delts look |
| 71:45 | [ __ ] awesome I can't wait for that to |
| 71:48 | be how I look when I wake up on a |
| 71:49 | morning and you go okay that's how I'm |
| 71:50 | going to get that and that's why it's |
| 71:52 | such a it's so gratifying |
| 71:55 | right it works in the moment and it |
| 71:57 | works over the long |
| 72:00 | term so one of my closest friends or my |
| 72:04 | closest friend Dr cashy and I talk about |
| 72:07 | this but the difference between experts |
| 72:09 | and beginners is that experts have more |
| 72:11 | ways to reward themselves in a given |
| 72:13 | condition and so if you think about an |
| 72:16 | expert salesman there are so many |
| 72:18 | interactions they can have that they are |
| 72:20 | good at that they can find rewarding and |
| 72:23 | positively reinforcing and so the goal |
| 72:25 | is to develop enough skill that your |
| 72:28 | external environment and conditions can |
| 72:32 | deliver enough positive feedback that it |
| 72:34 | can become self- sustaining give me a |
| 72:36 | tangible example so if you're an editor |
| 72:39 | and you edit videos for a living in the |
| 72:41 | beginning you have to you know you watch |
| 72:44 | a video and then you try the thing and |
| 72:46 | if it doesn't work there's no there's no |
| 72:48 | I mean there is a feedback loop it's |
| 72:49 | null um and then you go back you try it |
| 72:51 | again and then you do get a positive |
| 72:53 | feedback oh i' made that transition |
| 72:54 | happen I made that color grading occur |
| 72:56 | whatever I'm talking that a you get the |
| 72:59 | idea there are some roles like sales and |
| 73:03 | editing where there's a lot of people |
| 73:04 | who music where people become passionate |
| 73:07 | because there's enough fast feedback |
| 73:08 | loops in the beginning where they can |
| 73:09 | try something and then get good a master |
| 73:12 | musician can pick up any instrument and |
| 73:15 | have positive feedback loops everywhere |
| 73:17 | and so the more you master any skill the |
| 73:21 | more ways you can |
| 73:22 | win and so it allows and that's |
| 73:25 | ultimately what makes the rich get |
| 73:28 | richer is that because everything is so |
| 73:30 | positively reinforcing because they |
| 73:31 | start to develop skills then they do |
| 73:33 | more and more of it and as they do more |
| 73:35 | of it the rich get richer the better get |
| 73:37 | better the better become best and then |
| 73:39 | everyone who's starting out is like how |
| 73:40 | on God's Earth does this guy have this |
| 73:41 | work ethic but it's really that he has |
| 73:44 | high levels of |
| 73:46 | skill and all right I'm going to go on |
| 73:49 | attention here but I think it's going to |
| 73:50 | be worth it so I think about everything |
| 73:54 | in terms of skill |
| 73:56 | and I have more or less divorced myself |
| 73:59 | from the words like feelings |
| 74:02 | psychology uh intuition whatever I've |
| 74:05 | just I've just taken it out of my |
| 74:06 | vocabulary and simp character |
| 74:09 | traits and tried to focus ruthlessly on |
| 74:13 | what are the actions that I can take |
| 74:16 | to become patient and if you say hey be |
| 74:20 | patient what does someone do right they |
| 74:22 | have to figure out what to do in the |
| 74:23 | meantime that's the definition of |
| 74:25 | patience if you say hey be more |
| 74:27 | charismatic the problem with that |
| 74:29 | directive is that it's a bundled term |
| 74:33 | and |
| 74:34 | so I say charismatic but it what it |
| 74:36 | really means is 12 skills underneath of |
| 74:39 | it that means that when you walk into a |
| 74:40 | room stand up straight when you walk |
| 74:43 | into a room look everyone in the eyes |
| 74:45 | when you walk into a room announce |
| 74:46 | yourself speak louder Shake people's |
| 74:49 | hands and look at them while they're |
| 74:51 | talking when someone talks nod your head |
| 74:54 | if you do all of these 12 behaviors or |
| 74:56 | 15 behaviors people begin to describe |
| 74:58 | you as |
| 75:00 | charismatic |
| 75:04 | and in the path of personal development |
| 75:07 | we want to become more of these things |
| 75:10 | but we haven't chunked down the bundled |
| 75:12 | term into the series of behaviors that |
| 75:15 | create the description that people will |
| 75:17 | then call us later and I think by |
| 75:20 | breaking things down then it's not like |
| 75:23 | oh I'm just not that insert character |
| 75:25 | trait it's really oh I have not mastered |
| 75:28 | these 12 skills and so by doing that it |
| 75:32 | demystifies much more precise exactly |
| 75:35 | this is from a business perspective also |
| 75:37 | really good for training employees so |
| 75:38 | like for example on our team I was like |
| 75:40 | KB was the first person who did video |
| 75:42 | with me that I ever enjoyed and so I was |
| 75:44 | like why and then somebody else came in |
| 75:46 | and I was like I'm not having as much |
| 75:47 | fun in these sessions and I'd like to |
| 75:49 | recreate the conditions of success and |
| 75:51 | so how can I make it so that I |
| 75:53 | operationalize fun exactly |
| 75:55 | the most Alex hosy thing I've ever heard |
| 75:58 | hey hey guys let's operationalize fun |
| 76:00 | for a moment and so we had to but then |
| 76:03 | this is the part that everyone misses is |
| 76:05 | that you then have to look with a |
| 76:06 | microscope and say what are all the |
| 76:08 | little things that Caleb does that other |
| 76:09 | ones other people don't do and so it |
| 76:11 | turned out when he was behind the camera |
| 76:13 | he would be nodding his head and if I |
| 76:15 | said a banger line he would he would |
| 76:17 | stick his thumb out and so ID get these |
| 76:19 | many positive reinforcement Loops while |
| 76:20 | I was recording and then as soon as I |
| 76:22 | was done he would come over and be like |
| 76:24 | dude that was fire |
| 76:25 | and then he would take out his phone and |
| 76:27 | have all of these really interesting |
| 76:28 | follows because I could see that he was |
| 76:29 | actively listening and he had thoughts |
| 76:31 | and so then when we retrained the team |
| 76:34 | we said hey when Alex is is talking nod |
| 76:37 | your head slowly so he sees that you're |
| 76:38 | actively listening if he says something |
| 76:40 | cool do one of these give them a thumbs |
| 76:43 | up and then all of a sudden my recording |
| 76:44 | sessions without Caleb became as good as |
| 76:46 | my recording sessions with Caleb and we |
| 76:48 | operationalized Caleb ISM right and so I |
| 76:52 | could say I just need you to be more |
| 76:53 | like Caleb but that's not helpful to |
| 76:55 | somebody but if I said I need you to do |
| 76:57 | all these things then I can |
| 76:58 | operationalize that the reason I'm |
| 77:00 | hitting on this so hard is because this |
| 77:01 | has been such a core change in how I see |
| 77:03 | the world and it has been so useful in |
| 77:06 | terms of making bending reality to what |
| 77:09 | I would like it to be because there's |
| 77:11 | this huge disconnect between what people |
| 77:12 | want how they describe what they want |
| 77:14 | and what it takes for that to occur and |
| 77:20 | by by being able to look with detail |
| 77:24 | about the Char traits or the things that |
| 77:27 | people who are better than you at a |
| 77:28 | certain thing do you can then stop being |
| 77:31 | like man people think I'm a dick it's |
| 77:33 | like well if someone says stopping a |
| 77:35 | dick not helpful I mean good to know |
| 77:37 | that whatever I'm doing is not working |
| 77:40 | but doesn't give me any active |
| 77:41 | directions and so we just try to break |
| 77:43 | down ad acquisition. comom but in |
| 77:45 | general and for myself what are all what |
| 77:48 | is the 18 things that I have to do and |
| 77:50 | often times it's significantly more |
| 77:52 | things but they're also much easier than |
| 77:54 | you think think if I just said I need |
| 77:56 | you to nod your head while you're going |
| 77:57 | on camera it's not that complicated to |
| 77:59 | understand and so when you break it down |
| 78:01 | that way all of a sudden it become you |
| 78:02 | wrap your arms around it and you're like |
| 78:04 | oh so this is what it takes in order for |
| 78:06 | me to be an exceptional videographer |
| 78:08 | this is what it takes for me to be an |
| 78:10 | exceptional podcaster I'm sure and we |
| 78:12 | call like this is why I love living by |
| 78:13 | checklists but right now if you were to |
| 78:16 | if I were to say hey what makes a good |
| 78:17 | podcast you'd be like probably about 128 |
| 78:20 | things or more right but everyone on the |
| 78:24 | outside say say you're just so you're so |
| 78:26 | natural on camera you ask such |
| 78:28 | thought-provoking questions like man you |
| 78:30 | just get the best guests right and |
| 78:32 | you're like |
| 78:34 | sure and so this is but the thing is is |
| 78:36 | I think this is the mysticism this is |
| 78:38 | the unknown that the beginners or the |
| 78:40 | people at the very beginning of their |
| 78:41 | path don't understand is that there is |
| 78:44 | no magic there is no mysticism there is |
| 78:47 | no spirituality around this everything |
| 78:49 | comes down to behavior and ju and by |
| 78:52 | doing that you can take out all of the |
| 78:55 | the HBL all of the the voodoo that |
| 78:58 | unfortunately is so prevalent on social |
| 79:00 | media and so when you hear the the |
| 79:03 | podcast clips and whatever of people |
| 79:04 | saying you just need to be more this if |
| 79:06 | they haven't described it by a behavior |
| 79:09 | it is useless and so this has allowed me |
| 79:11 | to also separate signal from noise when |
| 79:13 | I'm consuming content in general or if I |
| 79:16 | want to learn something I'm immediately |
| 79:19 | thinking well what does this mean that I |
| 79:21 | have to do and if someone can't break it |
| 79:23 | down into the behaviors then they don't |
| 79:25 | know either and they may be very good at |
| 79:28 | the thing but they may be very bad at |
| 79:31 | teaching it and being able to separate |
| 79:33 | those two skills because those are |
| 79:34 | skills too being able to transfer a |
| 79:36 | skill is a |
| 79:38 | skill will allow you to audit who you're |
| 79:40 | listening to so that you can get the |
| 79:42 | highest return on your effort because |
| 79:44 | then you know that you're doing |
| 79:45 | activities that lead to the outcome that |
| 79:48 | you want we'll get back to talking to |

| 80:46 | to grow your business no matter what |
| 80:48 | stage you're in we have this big |
| 80:50 | nebulous term of anything let's call it |
| 80:53 | confidence and then there's these |
| 80:54 | component component parts that |
| 80:55 | confidence is made up of and only by |
| 80:57 | defining those can you actually bring it |
| 80:58 | closer to you yeah I think you know in |
| 81:01 | terms of getting people past the |
| 81:03 | paralysis of be confident like what the |
| 81:05 | [ __ ] does that even mean where do I |
| 81:07 | start what are the component parts of |
| 81:08 | confidence and yeah you know breaking |
| 81:12 | down any big thing into small manageable |
| 81:13 | steps is kind of the key to achieving |
| 81:15 | large |
| 81:16 | goals breaking down nebulous Concepts |
| 81:20 | into high resolution very tangible very |
| 81:24 | obvious individual |
| 81:26 | skills I I really like that I really |
| 81:28 | like |
| 81:29 | that I think it may be the single |
| 81:34 | source of singles tough one of the |
| 81:38 | largest correlates to what has worked |
| 81:40 | for me in my life because a lot of this |
| 81:43 | Obsession around this and you probably |
| 81:45 | know more about it off camera than |
| 81:46 | people can hear on |
| 81:49 | camera has come from me fundamentally |
| 81:52 | not understanding the world and so so I |
| 81:55 | put so much effort into trying to |
| 81:57 | understand when people would say do like |
| 82:00 | stop being that way or you're you're |
| 82:01 | really cocky or you're really arrogant |
| 82:04 | and I was like how do I not be that and |
| 82:07 | or you're really distractable or you're |
| 82:09 | really you know you're scattered and |
| 82:11 | these are all things that like you know |
| 82:12 | it hurts when you hear these things but |
| 82:14 | you're like okay but what do I do and so |
| 82:18 | I would encourage you if you have either |
| 82:20 | negative traits that you're trying to |
| 82:21 | get rid of or positive traits that |
| 82:23 | you're trying to acrew or become more |
| 82:25 | like to Simply demystify It by breaking |
| 82:29 | it down into the behaviors and when you |
| 82:30 | do that you'll realize that though there |
| 82:34 | may be many variables in that there are |
| 82:36 | lots of little things that it takes |
| 82:38 | they're usually not nearly as complex as |
| 82:41 | you'd think and so then you just start |
| 82:43 | looking at it as a checklist and saying |
| 82:44 | okay people think I'm arrogant when I |
| 82:47 | begin my conver begin talking to them |
| 82:50 | about how much money I make okay so I |
| 82:53 | have two options I can either be around |
| 82:55 | people who like talking about money and |
| 82:56 | don't see it as arrogant or when I'm |
| 82:58 | around people who I think have a high |
| 82:59 | likelihood of that and I care about |
| 83:02 | their opinion for some reason then I |
| 83:04 | won't begin that way and then all of a |
| 83:05 | sudden fewer and fewer people begin to |
| 83:07 | describe you as arrogant now you are |
| 83:09 | still the same but people would describe |
| 83:11 | you less in those terms and so I'll give |
| 83:14 | you a different example it's completely |
| 83:15 | off-the-wall here so one that was really |
| 83:18 | helpful for me was defining love and so |
| 83:21 | the problem with the English or all |
| 83:22 | languages is that there's many words |
| 83:24 | that mean the same thing and so we can |
| 83:26 | look up we you know Webster diary |
| 83:27 | whatever but if you actually look at the |
| 83:29 | definitions I think most words are |
| 83:30 | actually poorly defined because if you |
| 83:32 | Jus defy them by what someone has to do |
| 83:34 | then most definitions fall short and |
| 83:36 | many of them if you find online are |
| 83:37 | circular right but like likingness and |
| 83:41 | loving to me are a Continuum it's not |
| 83:42 | like I like this person I love this |
| 83:44 | person just just exists on this I hate |
| 83:46 | to I really like cool now if I were to |
| 83:50 | say I love you what does that mean |
| 83:53 | operationally |
| 83:54 | so for me I Define Love by what I'm |
| 83:56 | willing to give up to maintain my |
| 83:58 | relationship with something or |
| 84:00 | someone and so by using that definition |
| 84:03 | I was able to see huh maybe I don't love |
| 84:07 | my family as much as I thought because |
| 84:09 | I'm actually not willing to give up very |
| 84:11 | much in order to maintain this |
| 84:13 | relationship and I might actually love |
| 84:15 | my friend or I may love my |
| 84:18 | co-workers a lot more than I love my |
| 84:20 | family if we use the definition of what |
| 84:22 | I'm willing to give up in order to keep |
| 84:23 | it and then then the more I thought |
| 84:25 | about it I was like oh I love my goals |
| 84:28 | more than I love |
| 84:30 | anyone I'm not willing to give up my |
| 84:33 | goals in order to maintain a |
| 84:35 | relationship and so I actually when I |
| 84:37 | realized this I sat down with Leila and |
| 84:39 | I was like hey I think I love my goals |
| 84:41 | more than I love you how did that go |
| 84:44 | down great because she was like my whole |
| 84:47 | goal in life has been to help you |
| 84:49 | accomplish your goals and I think the |
| 84:50 | reason that we've had such an aligned |
| 84:52 | relationship is that both of us want to |
| 84:55 | help the other person achieve their |
| 84:56 | goals and in so doing then you're |
| 84:59 | aligned and it's like wow I I would give |
| 85:02 | up everything to maintain peace because |
| 85:05 | if Leila is the person on Earth that |
| 85:07 | helps me accomplish my goals more than |
| 85:08 | anyone else and my goals mean more to me |
| 85:11 | than any anything else is now the |
| 85:13 | conduit between the two yeah she's like |
| 85:15 | Inception mind [ __ ] you into yeah yeah |
| 85:18 | yeah now some people get really |
| 85:19 | uncomfortable by me saying that but it |
| 85:21 | sounds transactional in some ways and it |
| 85:24 | is I believe but I believe in |
| 85:25 | transactions and relationships in |
| 85:26 | general but when we sat like for some |
| 85:29 | reason in marriage it sounds weird but |
| 85:30 | on a first date the first thing you |
| 85:32 | share is these are my goals this is what |
| 85:33 | I want to do like is that at all |
| 85:36 | interesting to you because if it's not |
| 85:37 | if you're not aligned with where I'm |
| 85:38 | trying to go then maybe we shouldn't |
| 85:40 | walk in this path together but for some |
| 85:42 | reason later that no longer applies I |
| 85:44 | believe what you apply on first date |
| 85:46 | should also apply on 10 years in at |
| 85:49 | least that's what's worked for us and if |
| 85:50 | there's ever been a moment where we're |
| 85:51 | like hey we feel off-kilter here this |
| 85:54 | feels like it's conflicting with what we |
| 85:55 | our earlier agreement then we reconcile |
| 85:58 | it right and so I bring this up because |
| 86:00 | there are so many terms like loyalty |
| 86:02 | trust and I spend a lot of time trying |
| 86:04 | to Define these terms so that I can say |
| 86:07 | not do I trust this person but how much |
| 86:09 | do I trust this person this person is |
| 86:11 | honest or not no how honest is this |
| 86:14 | person and the only way that you can |
| 86:16 | know someone is honest if is if they've |
| 86:18 | had the opportunity to lie where it's |
| 86:21 | not socially where it's not socially |
| 86:23 | socially um beneficial for them where |
| 86:26 | they lose status by still being |
| 86:28 | integrous and saying what really |
| 86:30 | occurred and so I have this massive list |
| 86:32 | on my phone it's got all the all the |
| 86:34 | terms that I refer to frequently um but |
| 86:37 | I would encourage you to Define them by |
| 86:39 | what Behavior you have to do have you |
| 86:42 | got your phone on you now yeah can you |
| 86:44 | pull up one and give us a give us a t |
| 86:47 | that you like to look I'll give a phone |
| 86:48 | one I have tons this is fun wait words |
| 86:51 | and that's one of the things that uh I |
| 86:54 | appreciate |
| 86:55 | is anybody that spends enough time |
| 86:58 | crafting words and thinking about them |
| 87:00 | precisely ends up having a very accurate |
| 87:02 | view of the world because all of the |
| 87:03 | fluffiness that comes about we we |
| 87:04 | mediate our experience through language |
| 87:07 | and then what you've got a [ __ ] eating |
| 87:09 | grin on your face I've just got so many |
| 87:11 | okay well what pick pick one of your |
| 87:12 | favor I'll do I'll do I'll do two three |
| 87:16 | of them two of them that interr related |
| 87:18 | then a different and then a third one |
| 87:20 | all right so |
| 87:24 | this will be really good this will this |
| 87:26 | will be nasty for the people who are |
| 87:27 | listening at home |
| 87:30 | so learning means same condition new |
| 87:33 | Behavior so phone rings you answer the |
| 87:36 | phone you say |
| 87:37 | ABC I say cool read this script instead |
| 87:41 | that says DF phone rings same condition |
| 87:45 | you say DF you have learned same |
| 87:48 | condition new |
| 87:50 | Behavior |
| 87:51 | intelligence is rat of learning it's |
| 87:55 | speed it's a measurement of speed and so |
| 87:58 | it means how many times do you need to |
| 88:00 | be exposed to the same condition in |
| 88:02 | order to change your behavior if I teach |
| 88:05 | someone something that's script and then |
| 88:07 | on the first try they say DF and someone |
| 88:09 | else it takes five tries for them to say |
| 88:11 | TEF they are not as intelligent as the |
| 88:13 | first person here's why this is |
| 88:15 | interesting every person who's listening |
| 88:17 | to this right now has listened to a |
| 88:19 | thousand [ __ ] podcasts and they're in |
| 88:21 | the exact same condition and yet they |
| 88:23 | have not changed their their behavior |
| 88:24 | which means one they have not learned |
| 88:26 | and two they are dumb which also means |
| 88:30 | that if you can control your behavior |
| 88:31 | you can also control how intelligent you |
| 88:33 | are and so if you want to be a smart |
| 88:35 | cookie then it means that you just |
| 88:37 | decrease the amount of times that you do |
| 88:39 | not change your behavior under the same |
| 88:41 | conditions and so when I think about |
| 88:44 | this when I teach my team when I teach |
| 88:45 | anyone I think in these conditions and |
| 88:49 | so every time you watch or you consume a |
| 88:51 | piece of content you read a book if you |
| 88:53 | think what be behavior I'm going am I |
| 88:55 | going to change as a result of this if |
| 88:56 | the answer is nothing you wasted your |
| 88:59 | time and you pretended to be learning |
| 89:01 | but you were really entertaining |
| 89:03 | yourself and so that frame has been |
| 89:05 | incredibly helpful for me to speed up |
| 89:07 | how quickly I take action because I |
| 89:09 | don't want to be a dodo |
| 89:11 | bird so that's two two different ones |
| 89:14 | learning and |
| 89:16 | intelligence one that I've been thinking |
| 89:19 | a lot about with Dr K and how we go back |
| 89:22 | and forth is motivation |
| 89:26 | so I'll tell you a story and then I'll |
| 89:28 | I'll bring it I'll bring it around so I |
| 89:30 | had uh I was at an event and a young |
| 89:33 | lady |
| 89:33 | said Alex can you just give me 60 |
| 89:36 | seconds of |
| 89:37 | motivation and of course it's like you |
| 89:39 | know dance monkey dance and so I I you |
| 89:43 | know I took a deep breath and I was like |
| 89:46 | Define |
| 89:47 | motivation and you know she just like |
| 89:49 | melted she had no idea right I was like |
| 89:51 | so you're you want me to answer a |
| 89:53 | question or make a statement about |
| 89:55 | something that you can't even Define and |
| 89:56 | so how would you have any idea of |
| 89:58 | whether or not I actually did |
| 90:01 | it and so then I probably gave her the |
| 90:03 | answer she really wanted which was let |
| 90:04 | me Define motivation for you so |
| 90:07 | motivation is the equal opposite of |
| 90:10 | deprivation so we are we are most |
| 90:14 | motivated when we are deprived of |
| 90:16 | something I'm most motivated to sleep |
| 90:18 | when I'm sleep deprived I'm most |
| 90:19 | motivated to eat when I'm deprived of |
| 90:21 | food I'm most motivated to have sex when |
| 90:23 | I have sex in a while now that logic |
| 90:26 | carries for physiological needs but then |
| 90:28 | you would to get into psychological |
| 90:30 | things or or intangible constructs so |
| 90:33 | like let's think about money by that |
| 90:34 | same logic you'd think oh poor people |
| 90:36 | should be more motivated because they're |
| 90:37 | deprived of money but that we don't see |
| 90:39 | that in reality many poor people are not |
| 90:41 | that motivated so it would then follow |
| 90:45 | and I've seen some incredibly rich |
| 90:46 | people who are wildly hungry for money |
| 90:49 | and so then it would follow that the |
| 90:51 | deprivation comes from our reference |
| 90:53 | point because money is intangible and so |
| 90:55 | it's how much do we perceive our |
| 90:57 | deprivation around money and so if all |
| 91:00 | of my friends are billionaires and I'm |
| 91:01 | worth $100 million then I have a $900 |
| 91:05 | million deficit that I have to come up |
| 91:07 | I'm $900 million poorer than the person |
| 91:10 | who just is at 5,000 a month who wants |
| 91:12 | to make $110,000 a month I'm more |
| 91:14 | motivated to make money than they are |
| 91:16 | because I'm more deprived of it and so |
| 91:19 | in thinking about this I then think okay |
| 91:23 | what am I deprived |
| 91:25 | of that motivates me to go get it and |
| 91:28 | also when I want to try and judge the |
| 91:30 | behavior of others or predict their |
| 91:32 | behavior I have to think what things are |
| 91:34 | they deprived of because would have a |
| 91:36 | much stronger predictive power than |
| 91:39 | trying to say how do I motivate this |
| 91:42 | person look at what they |
| 91:45 | lack it's a much |
| 91:47 | more accurate way to predict the things |
| 91:50 | that people are going to chase after |
| 91:52 | operationalized what do they do |
| 91:54 | so I found this quote from Timothy |
| 91:57 | ly and it really it's really fantastic I |
| 92:01 | think that you like this find the others |
| 92:04 | admit it you aren't like them you're not |
| 92:07 | even close you may occasionally dress |
| 92:09 | yourself up as one of them watch the |
| 92:11 | same mindless television shows as they |
| 92:12 | do maybe even eat the same fast food |
| 92:15 | sometimes but it seems that the more you |
| 92:18 | try to fit in the more you feel like an |
| 92:21 | outsider watching normal people as they |
| 92:24 | go about their automatic existences for |
| 92:26 | every time you say Club passwords like |
| 92:29 | have a nice day and weather's awful |
| 92:31 | today e you yearn inside to say |
| 92:33 | forbidden things like tell me something |
| 92:35 | that makes you cry or what do you think |
| 92:37 | Deja Vu is for face it you even want to |
| 92:40 | talk to that girl in the elevator but |
| 92:42 | what if that girl in the elevator and |
| 92:43 | the Bolding man who walks past your |
| 92:45 | cubicle at work are thinking the same |
| 92:47 | thing who knows what you might learn |
| 92:49 | from taking a chance on a conversation |
| 92:51 | with a stranger everybody carries a |
| 92:54 | piece of the puzzle nobody comes into |
| 92:56 | your life by mere coincidence trust your |
| 92:58 | instincts do the unexpected find the |
| 93:04 | others there's many Matrix undertones |
| 93:08 | here |
| 93:13 | um I mean I think we might have we might |
| 93:16 | have covered this on a past podcast but |
| 93:18 | um the idea that many people want to be |
| 93:21 | exceptional but they're afraid of being |
| 93:23 | an exception I think is such a it's it's |
| 93:26 | wanting it's wanting an outcome without |
| 93:30 | the |
| 93:31 | requirement that the outcome has and so |
| 93:36 | we can't do the same thing that everyone |
| 93:38 | else approves of and then somehow get a |
| 93:41 | different outcome than everyone else |
| 93:42 | does and so I think it's that's why High |
| 93:45 | that's why High Agency for me is |
| 93:47 | something that I look for in other |
| 93:48 | people which is you know asking someone |
| 93:51 | why do you believe what you believe and |
| 93:53 | we talk about this yesterday |
| 93:57 | but if you have a belief and you can't |
| 94:00 | explain why you believe it it's not |
| 94:03 | yours it's someone |
| 94:05 | else's and most people walk around |
| 94:09 | parting other people's words for the |
| 94:11 | vast majority of their lives and so they |
| 94:13 | basically act as recorders where they |
| 94:15 | clicked record at at one part of their |
| 94:16 | life and then they click play in another |
| 94:18 | time of their life and they're just |
| 94:19 | clicking record play record play record |
| 94:21 | play over and over again and |
| 94:25 | the reason there's that in my opinion |
| 94:27 | that other self that's behind it is |
| 94:29 | because none of those words are yours |
| 94:31 | and so it makes sense that people feel |
| 94:35 | alone and they feel like they're acting |
| 94:37 | because they never say what they |
| 94:40 | think and as a result they also sound |
| 94:43 | like everyone else because they were |
| 94:45 | never themselves to begin with it's |
| 94:47 | those first three lines admit it you |
| 94:50 | aren't like them you're not even close |
| 94:52 | and it sounds |
| 94:54 | quite sort of self aggrandizing or or |
| 94:57 | kind of narcissistic in a way to oh you |
| 95:00 | considering yourself as being above |
| 95:02 | other people I think I don't think it's |
| 95:03 | to do with that I think it's that so |
| 95:06 | many |
| 95:08 | people Cil themselves and optimize for a |
| 95:11 | mean that may not exist you know they're |
| 95:14 | reverting to a mean that's just a |
| 95:16 | figment of everybody's imagination and |
| 95:18 | the only reason that people coales there |
| 95:19 | is because other people think that other |
| 95:21 | people are going to coales there you |
| 95:22 | know the Keeny and beauty contest same |
| 95:25 | same as that basically I don't know what |
| 95:26 | it is oh okay so Kian beauty contest is |
| 95:29 | uh people make judgments on not who they |
| 95:32 | think is the most beautiful but on who |
| 95:35 | they think other people think are the |
| 95:36 | most beautiful and they're knowing that |
| 95:38 | other people know that other people are |
| 95:40 | going to make that decision based on |
| 95:41 | that you end up with this infinite |
| 95:42 | regress of trying to predict things this |
| 95:44 | is what's happening with politics right |
| 95:46 | it's not about picking the person that |
| 95:48 | you want in your area it's about making |
| 95:50 | the most tactical pick to ensure that |
| 95:51 | overall accounting for the other people |
| 95:53 | and what they're going to choose that |
| 95:54 | the person that you really don't want in |
| 95:55 | power doesn't get the seat in your area |
| 95:57 | but somebody else in some other area so |
| 95:59 | when you have this sort of recursive but |
| 96:00 | it it happens socially too I say the |
| 96:05 | thing that I think that you want to hear |
| 96:07 | knowing that you know that I could say |
| 96:10 | the thing that I want but so what I say |
| 96:12 | is some mediator halfway between what I |
| 96:14 | want to say and what I think you want to |
| 96:15 | hear from me and it just ends up with |
| 96:19 | people nobody being themselves and |
| 96:22 | everybody being some weird |
| 96:25 | simum of what they think everybody else |
| 96:27 | wants them to be and if we go back to |
| 96:30 | motivation the question is what quote |
| 96:33 | motivates people to do this or or to |
| 96:36 | behave in this way and so most times |
| 96:39 | it's fear of something right and so |
| 96:41 | they're afraid |
| 96:43 | of something in their minds but when you |
| 96:46 | actually play it out which is one of my |
| 96:47 | favorite frames in the world which is |
| 96:49 | let's take this to the hypothetical |
| 96:50 | extreme or let's play it out two more |
| 96:52 | two more plays two more turns |
| 96:54 | and most times you end up getting way |
| 96:56 | closer to what you really want the |
| 96:58 | moment after the bad thing that you |
| 97:00 | think will happen happens and so we've |
| 97:03 | we've discussed that that there's so |
| 97:04 | many amazing things that have happened |
| 97:06 | in my life and your life and many |
| 97:08 | people's lives that happened immediately |
| 97:10 | after they get out they have something |
| 97:12 | bad happen that gets them out of that |
| 97:14 | realm of just barely good enough but not |
| 97:16 | really and so we have this fear of |
| 97:18 | disrupting that just barely good enough |
| 97:20 | but not really but you're also already |
| 97:22 | miserable and so the fear of disrupting |
| 97:24 | your misery feels ridiculous and so when |
| 97:28 | you think about it like that right so |
| 97:29 | when you think about it like that |
| 97:31 | exactly the only thing we have to lose |
| 97:33 | is the current misery of mediocrity that |
| 97:36 | we're trudging through every day and so |
| 97:40 | worst case you're just also still |
| 97:43 | miserable but maybe you won't be |
| 97:44 | mediocre anymore because at least you |
| 97:46 | won't be like everyone else but there's |
| 97:47 | also a possibility that you are not |
| 97:49 | miserable and also not mediocre and by |
| 97:52 | doing that you might also |
| 97:54 | just start seeing who you really are |
| 97:56 | because I think a great portion of our |
| 97:58 | identity comes from the proof that we |
| 97:59 | give ourselves of the things that we've |
| 98:00 | done and said in the past and so if we |
| 98:03 | want to build towards a different |
| 98:04 | version of ourselves then it begins with |
| 98:06 | acre stacking |
| 98:09 | evidence that aligns with that future |
| 98:12 | self and so in some |
| 98:14 | ways break the |
| 98:17 | plate take the shot get |
| 98:20 | rejected because when you do that then |
| 98:24 | again the worst case is you have a |
| 98:25 | broken plate but you didn't like that |
| 98:27 | plate to begin |
| 98:28 | with it is astounding how many people |
| 98:32 | want to be spectacular in life but also |
| 98:34 | want to fit in and be normal like by |
| 98:36 | being normal You Are by |
| 98:39 | definition aiming for average normal |
| 98:42 | people get normal results weird people |
| 98:45 | get weird results you literally can't do |
| 98:47 | what everyone else does and not expect |
| 98:49 | to get what everyone else has by doing |
| 98:51 | what everyone else does you guarantee |
| 98:53 | average |
| 99:01 | results it's your brother your mom your |
| 99:06 | friend the one comment they're going to |
| 99:09 | say you've changed why are you doing |
| 99:12 | another kick like this oh you're going |
| 99:14 | to try that now okay here we go |
| 99:17 | again and the thing is is that it's not |
| 99:21 | about them being right or wrong again |
| 99:22 | it's about how right and how wrong they |
| 99:25 | could be and so for example let's say |
| 99:28 | you wanted to start a podcast in the |
| 99:29 | past and you did three episodes and then |
| 99:32 | you fell off and then they think I told |
| 99:35 | you so stop with these dreams stop with |
| 99:37 | this crazy content stuff you're never |
| 99:39 | going to become an influencer or |
| 99:40 | whatever your goal is replace influencer |
| 99:42 | with what whatever your thing is the |
| 99:44 | thing is is that you are still closer |
| 99:46 | having done three than having done zero |
| 99:48 | and so it's just about directional |
| 99:51 | correctness and real realizing |
| 99:55 | that |
| 99:57 | criticizers are more often |
| 100:01 | correct |
| 100:07 | but when it matters most Incorrect and |
| 100:12 | so this is where frequency and intensity |
| 100:14 | become uh flipped so somebody I mean |
| 100:19 | from the investment world it's like okay |
| 100:20 | if I take 10 bets and I lose nine some |
| 100:23 | people might say he must be a bad |
| 100:25 | investor but the question is how much |
| 100:26 | did I lose on the nine and how much did |
| 100:28 | I make on the one and the best investors |
| 100:30 | in the world understand the benefits of |
| 100:32 | outside returns both on the upside and |
| 100:34 | the downside and so meaning the perfect |
| 100:37 | way of betting is having no downside and |
| 100:39 | having a limited upside you want to make |
| 100:40 | as many of those bets as you can and in |
| 100:42 | the beginning that is literally what you |
| 100:43 | have and so the problem is you have a |
| 100:47 | bet that you take you make three |
| 100:49 | podcasts and you didn't stick with it |
| 100:51 | and so then criticizer gets one point |
| 100:54 | but you lost nothing you maybe even |
| 100:57 | gained a little bit of skill and you |
| 100:59 | gained some experience which means |
| 101:00 | you're actually still better off than |
| 101:02 | than you were when you started so it is |
| 101:04 | a zerol loss game by choosing to begin |
| 101:08 | that's the thing about |
| 101:11 | cynic right 99% of the time and wrong |
| 101:15 | 100% of the time I use this example |
| 101:17 | because I think it really drives it home |
| 101:18 | so if you if you have judgmental parents |
| 101:21 | or judgmental friends or judgmental |
| 101:22 | whatevers and you date people and you |
| 101:24 | bring them home if they say I don't |
| 101:27 | think this is the girl for you they're |
| 101:29 | right every single time your entire life |
| 101:33 | except for the one person that you |
| 101:35 | decide to marry and then they are |
| 101:37 | absolutely wrong at the time that it |
| 101:39 | mattered most and the thing is is they |
| 101:41 | get to say on your sixth girlfriend and |
| 101:42 | seventh girlfriend and eighth girlfriend |
| 101:44 | because let's face it you've been alive |
| 101:45 | for a |
| 101:46 | while I have a perfect I have a perfect |
| 101:49 | guess I'm right 100% of the time this Ru |
| 101:52 | will see how long this one lasts and two |
| 101:54 | years in they're like see you finally |
| 101:56 | broke up with her I told you at the |
| 101:57 | beginning it wasn't going to last well |
| 101:59 | it never [ __ ] lasts except for the |
| 102:00 | one that's going to stick duh and the |
| 102:03 | business never works until it's the one |
| 102:05 | that does and the episode doesn't take |
| 102:09 | off except for the one that does and |
| 102:11 | whether it's 10 or 10,000 eventually one |
| 102:14 | does because when you do more you get |
| 102:16 | better at |
| 102:17 | doing which is why not quitting is the |
| 102:19 | best skill and the only thing that |
| 102:21 | matters because by default with an |
| 102:23 | infinite game perspective which I |
| 102:25 | encourage everyone to have the point of |
| 102:26 | the game is to keep the game going it's |
| 102:29 | the only objective because even if I |
| 102:32 | obviously come from the business world |
| 102:33 | so even if your goal was to be number |
| 102:36 | one at business it's like by what metric |
| 102:38 | Enterprise Value growth profit Revenue |
| 102:40 | all of a sudden okay maybe it's richest |
| 102:42 | man in the world okay for how long look |
| 102:44 | at the history of mankind not one person |
| 102:46 | has ever been richest man forever and so |
| 102:48 | you get to touch the top even if you're |
| 102:50 | that one guy for a moment and then it's |
| 102:52 | gone again |
| 102:53 | and so you can't have that as the the |
| 102:56 | end point because it is bides very |
| 102:58 | nature finite but the competitor who |
| 103:01 | objective is to continue to play can't |
| 103:03 | be beaten because by playing he wins |
| 103:06 | this is why I think a lot of people have |
| 103:09 | chips on their shoulders once they get |
| 103:12 | to even a modicum of success |
| 103:17 | because everybody that starts off has |
| 103:20 | this huge amount of Escape veloc vity |
| 103:23 | that's needed to be accumulated starting |
| 103:25 | from Total inertia lifting off where the |
| 103:27 | gravity is strongest going past all of |
| 103:30 | these the disbelief and the criticism |
| 103:32 | and the lonely chapter and all of this |
| 103:34 | stuff so they've had to go through all |
| 103:37 | of these trenches and get over all of |
| 103:38 | these hurdles and then they finally get |
| 103:41 | to the stage where they're in a little |
| 103:43 | bit more light altitude they're floating |
| 103:46 | out there a little bit more and maybe |
| 103:48 | their uh velocity gives them or their |
| 103:50 | their fuel gives them more returns in |
| 103:51 | terms of their velocity |
| 103:53 | and now people say I must be nice for |
| 103:56 | you and you go dude [ __ ] you like if you |
| 104:00 | could have seen how much criticism and |
| 104:04 | hard work and lonely nights and all of |
| 104:05 | this stuff when nobody was watching and |
| 104:06 | I was was unsure of myself chronically |
| 104:09 | miserable and I criticized and all my |
| 104:11 | friends took the piss out me and I did |
| 104:12 | all of these things I had to go through |
| 104:14 | all of that for you to now say must be |
| 104:18 | nice and that's why you know Cameron |
| 104:20 | Haynes um carries this rock up ahead |
| 104:23 | and it says poser on the back of it 72b |
| 104:27 | Rock and he carries it up a really |
| 104:29 | really steep hill and he does it with |
| 104:31 | sometimes there's cameras around but a |
| 104:32 | lot of the time there's no cameras |
| 104:33 | around and uh he does that to it's the |
| 104:37 | the only work that matters is the work |
| 104:38 | that you do when nobody's |
| 104:41 | watching the reason the goal isn't |
| 104:44 | coming at you fast enough is because |
| 104:46 | every person you've seen accomplish the |
| 104:48 | goal you only see it the moment they |
| 104:51 | accomplish it and the reason that |
| 104:53 | it hurts so much when people are like |
| 104:56 | must be nice oh that happened overnight |
| 105:00 | is because every time you fail no one |
| 105:03 | cares and no one sees but when you |
| 105:05 | finally win people take notice |
| 105:08 | discredited but it's the only time they |
| 105:10 | notice is when you actually win and so |
| 105:12 | to even further reinforce the point the |
| 105:15 | fact that everyone looks like an |
| 105:17 | overnight success means that the 10 |
| 105:20 | years where they sucked no one saw and |
| 105:24 | so the fear that you have about people |
| 105:26 | noticing the fact that you fail is |
| 105:28 | ridiculous because they're barely going |
| 105:30 | to notice when you |
| 105:34 | succeed yeah I think this is one of the |
| 105:36 | reasons why tracking the journey this is |
| 105:39 | something that uh Chris bumstead's done |
| 105:41 | very well you know he's had his um |
| 105:44 | videographer Calvin with him for forever |
| 105:46 | essentially and you know tracking |
| 105:48 | autoimmune disorders and and depression |
| 105:51 | and his wife's pregnant and then having |
| 105:54 | the kid and I got to come back and do |
| 105:55 | yeah yeah all of that |
| 105:58 | um I |
| 106:00 | think one of the ways that you can at |
| 106:03 | least lighten the load or bring it into |
| 106:05 | land a little bit more effectively is to |
| 106:08 | construct that story arc you know the |
| 106:10 | story of you sleeping in the gym and the |
| 106:11 | cars go over the top and it makes the |
| 106:13 | loud noise and stuff that is an |
| 106:17 | important part of getting people to buy |
| 106:19 | into where you are now by proving that |
| 106:21 | you were there when the line was flat or |
| 106:23 | the actually somehow managed to break |
| 106:25 | through the floor and go negative a |
| 106:27 | number of times and |
| 106:30 | um I remember I was watching Maisy |
| 106:32 | Williams she was one of the she was Arya |
| 106:35 | Stark in Game of Thrones and um somebody |
| 106:38 | asked her what she wished that she'd |
| 106:40 | done |
| 106:41 | differently and you know I think she |
| 106:43 | starts on that show and she's 11 or 12 |
| 106:48 | and it's all of the most formative years |
| 106:50 | of her life until she's or something in |
| 106:54 | the decade of doing this |
| 106:55 | show and somebody asked her what she |
| 106:57 | wished that she'd done differently and |
| 107:00 | she started journaling I think in season |
| 107:02 | five and there's maybe nine Seasons or |
| 107:05 | something and she had no recollection of |
| 107:08 | what happened in the beginning and she |
| 107:09 | really wanted that and I think that uh |
| 107:13 | if there's a regret that I have with |
| 107:14 | this show it's that we didn't track more |
| 107:15 | of what was happening behind the scenes |
| 107:17 | from the very |
| 107:18 | beginning partly for everybody else to |
| 107:22 | show just how much [ __ ] I went through |
| 107:24 | to kind of prove that but more so for me |
| 107:27 | to remind myself of where it was and I'm |
| 107:29 | sure that you know there's a couple of |
| 107:32 | photos you know the bed in the corner of |
| 107:34 | the gym like [ __ ] I wish like I had that |
| 107:35 | and I wish I had this and I wish I had |
| 107:37 | another one uh you know if you'd had |
| 107:39 | Caleb with you the whole time imagine |
| 107:40 | how [ __ ] I'd be poor and |
| 107:43 | broke I never would have made it out |
| 107:45 | probably Pro probably in [ __ ] |
| 107:47 | hospital as well being on the back of a |
| 107:49 | motorcycle um but yeah I I I think it's |
| 107:53 | important I think it's important to |
| 107:54 | track that to track that Journey for |
| 107:55 | yourself and for for other people but |
| 107:57 | it's such it does piss me off like I |
| 108:01 | wish that human psychology wasn't so |
| 108:04 | easily manipulated like when you see |
| 108:06 | that trick when you see the well if you |
| 108:08 | go Zero to Hero even if you go Zero to |
| 108:10 | Hero to zero to back to Hero again like |
| 108:14 | as long as you can construct that |
| 108:15 | narrative sufficiently strongly for |
| 108:17 | people you can just get other humans to |
| 108:21 | buy into you but it hasn't changed what |
| 108:24 | you did it's just changed the way that |
| 108:26 | you presented it to people and the story |
| 108:28 | that you told so it when you start to |
| 108:30 | see things like that it |
| 108:32 | makes I find it disenchanting because it |
| 108:35 | reminds me how fickle crowd mentality is |
| 108:38 | and it's why uh Ethan SLE um big |
| 108:42 | Hollywood actor weighed 500 or something |
| 108:46 | and now he's 260 and he used to play Fat |
| 108:50 | Guy funny roles and now he plays Jack |
| 108:52 | bearded biker dude roles and the reason |
| 108:55 | that his transformation is so fantastic |
| 108:57 | is that you know him from before and you |
| 108:59 | know him now but the dude that just gets |
| 109:01 | in shape or that goes through the silent |
| 109:04 | quiet Challenge and didn't track the |
| 109:06 | progress gets noneof the Accolade |
| 109:08 | despite going through all or maybe even |
| 109:10 | more of the |
| 109:12 | challenge so much done pack |
| 109:16 | um I'd say one of the strongest mental |
| 109:19 | frames that has gotten me through my |
| 109:20 | hardest times is thinking this will be |
| 109:24 | the story that I will one day tell and |
| 109:27 | that means the harder it is the bigger |
| 109:29 | the dragon the more epic the story and |
| 109:33 | by Consequence the more epic the |
| 109:35 | hero and if you think about the |
| 109:37 | difference between winners and losers |
| 109:40 | winners Define themselves by what they |
| 109:43 | made happen and losers Define themselves |
| 109:46 | by what happened to |
| 109:48 | them and the difficult part of the |
| 109:51 | Lonely chapter |
| 109:53 | is that the rocky cut scene lasts 90 |
| 109:56 | seconds in the movie and lasts five |
| 109:58 | years in reality with no promise of it |
| 110:01 | ever ending no guarantee of |
| 110:05 | Glory what's interesting about and I |
| 110:07 | don't again I don't like using the word |
| 110:09 | psychology but I'll say what's |
| 110:10 | interesting about humans is that our |
| 110:12 | ability to endure is very robust if we |
| 110:17 | know that we'll make it out and so |
| 110:19 | they've done mice studies where they |
| 110:21 | drop the mouse in |
| 110:23 | and then they let it drown and it drowns |
| 110:24 | really fast and then they drop a mouse |
| 110:27 | in and then before it gets to the point |
| 110:29 | where it drowns they pick it up and then |
| 110:31 | they put it back in and the second time |
| 110:33 | they put it in it can last like 20 times |
| 110:35 | longer I think for the stats of |
| 110:38 | something around will drown in less than |
| 110:40 | an hour if it's taken out dried off and |
| 110:42 | allowed to relax it'll swim for a day an |
| 110:45 | absurd amount different and so if I were |
| 110:47 | to say hey I need you to hold your |
| 110:50 | breath but I don't tell you how |
| 110:53 | long 20 seconds in you might be thinking |
| 110:56 | this is stupid when is he going to stop |
| 110:58 | is he going to wait for me to pass out |
| 110:59 | and all these stupid thoughts go into |
| 111:01 | your mind but if I say I need you to |
| 111:03 | hold your breath for three |
| 111:06 | minutes your lungs might burn but you |
| 111:09 | can see that there's this end that's |
| 111:11 | coming the difficulty with personal |
| 111:13 | development and Entrepreneurship is that |
| 111:15 | you don't know when the end is coming |
| 111:17 | but you still need to fight like the |
| 111:18 | second mouse who gets out gets red off |
| 111:21 | and gets put back in |
| 111:23 | and the only certainty that I can give |
| 111:24 | you is that it's the same thing that |
| 111:26 | every other Mouse every other person who |
| 111:28 | got through that period went through and |
| 111:31 | you won't die and if you do die you |
| 111:33 | won't care because you'll be |
| 111:37 | dead and so best case you win worst case |
| 111:41 | it won't |
| 111:50 | matter it's the same mentality it's the |
| 111:52 | same reason why Uber works the reason |
| 111:55 | that Uber works is partly because you |
| 111:56 | can get a car from anywhere but the real |
| 111:59 | reason is that you know when the car's |
| 112:00 | going to arrive MH you know remember |
| 112:03 | back in the day you'd ring a taxi and |
| 112:04 | then just wait and you go well I mean |
| 112:07 | he's some far away I don't know how far |
| 112:10 | away and then it ends up coming along |
| 112:13 | we've mentioned it a couple of times |
| 112:14 | today a frame that I've used North a lot |
| 112:16 | over the last year or so uh is this is |
| 112:21 | the price of doings business M uh so |
| 112:24 | reframing things from Bugs to Features |
| 112:27 | MH uh you know you need to get into one |
| 112:29 | of my nightclubs 10 years ago there's an |
| 112:31 | entry fee at the door and this is the |
| 112:32 | cost of doing business I remember uh |
| 112:34 | Facebook got this the biggest fine in |
| 112:36 | Tech History maybe 10 years ago or |
| 112:38 | something like that and they |
| 112:40 | find some obscene numbers absolutely |
| 112:43 | huge number and somebody worked it out |
| 112:44 | that it was like half of one quarter of |
| 112:47 | one territory's profit and you think |
| 112:50 | well I'm I'm aware that in sort of |
| 112:53 | absolute terms this is a massive number |
| 112:55 | but in relative terms they can just go |
| 112:57 | okay well we'll just Factor this into |
| 112:58 | the p&l and go through this |
| 113:00 | so thinking about the byproduct of |
| 113:03 | things that other people see as |
| 113:06 | a luxury that you have uh reduction of |
| 113:10 | privacy that that comes along perhaps |
| 113:12 | with increasing the size of your |
| 113:13 | platform and you go okay well I can |
| 113:17 | shout and scream and rail against this |
| 113:19 | uh people saying must be nice you know |
| 113:22 | that's a good one [ __ ] hell that's a |
| 113:23 | difficult one I going to get people |
| 113:25 | saying must be nice because I just got a |
| 113:27 | promotion at work |
| 113:30 | and that's unfair because I worked hard |
| 113:33 | for that and I want them to say to me |
| 113:35 | well done I know that you probably went |
| 113:38 | through tons of hardship that I didn't |
| 113:40 | see or wow you've really changed the |
| 113:43 | texture of your mind due to all of that |
| 113:44 | meditation that you did um I'm sure that |
| 113:48 | 500 Mornings in a row sat on a cushion |
| 113:51 | in your bedroom in butt [ __ ] nowhere |
| 113:54 | listening to Sam Harris speak in your |
| 113:55 | ears was really really tough they're not |
| 113:58 | going to say that they're going to say |
| 114:00 | well I mean it's all right for you man |
| 114:02 | you just don't seem to get angry that |
| 114:03 | easily you go dude you know [ __ ] |
| 114:06 | nothing about me you have no idea how |
| 114:08 | hard it was for me to get from where I |
| 114:09 | was to where I am |
| 114:11 | now but instead of seeing that as you |
| 114:15 | cannot change what other people are |
| 114:16 | going to say because that is the natural |
| 114:19 | human response to minimize progress that |
| 114:22 | other people have made in order to |
| 114:24 | shorten the gap between you and them |
| 114:26 | because if it's due to hard work that's |
| 114:27 | something that they could have done if |
| 114:28 | it's due to Natural innate Talent OR |
| 114:31 | genetic predisposition that's something |
| 114:33 | that they have no control over so it |
| 114:35 | shortens the gap of work and worth |
| 114:38 | between you and them so instead of |
| 114:40 | seeing it as oh my God this is malignant |
| 114:42 | and a personal curse and so [ __ ] |
| 114:44 | unfair you just go this is the price of |
| 114:47 | doing business if I want to be a mindful |
| 114:50 | person people are going to say to me |
| 114:51 | dude you just seem so calm all the time |
| 114:53 | I wish I was like you I wish I was built |
| 114:55 | like you but you know I just had too |
| 114:56 | hard of a childhood or dude you you |
| 114:58 | you're doing so well at work I wish that |
| 115:00 | I didn't have the kids or I didn't have |
| 115:02 | those restrictions or that my parents |
| 115:04 | had taught me more about |
| 115:06 | business it's just the price of doing |
| 115:08 | business you know a fun frame with that |
| 115:11 | is when someone says must be nice you |
| 115:15 | can just say yeah it |
| 115:18 | is or someone says man you must have |
| 115:21 | exceptional genetic ICS to have the body |
| 115:23 | you have and it just happens so easily |
| 115:25 | for you and you're like yeah it's |
| 115:28 | sweet and the thing is is that if we |
| 115:31 | think if we were to just say like if we |
| 115:32 | lean into it right to some degree by |
| 115:36 | leaning into it you also eliminate a |
| 115:37 | competitor if you want to hear my my |
| 115:39 | ugly side because if I just affirm the |
| 115:41 | fact that they think it happened |
| 115:42 | overnight or that it was genetic or |
| 115:44 | whatever makes it more Out Of Reach |
| 115:46 | right yeah I've thought dude I've |
| 115:47 | thought about this so this is such a |
| 115:49 | good point such a good point the |
| 115:53 | somebody telling you going David Goggins |
| 115:56 | mode and somebody |
| 115:58 | saying this is how hard I had to work to |
| 116:01 | achieve this thing look at how hard I |
| 116:03 | had to go through and look at all of the |
| 116:05 | setbacks I had and look at just how in |
| 116:07 | the red I was before I got to the black |
| 116:10 | before I got to the green just look at |
| 116:11 | all of these things people see that as a |
| 116:14 | threat people see that as a humble brag |
| 116:16 | but what it is is a treasure |
| 116:18 | map this is where I was and this is |
| 116:21 | where I went and me with all of my |
| 116:23 | inefficiencies and deficiencies and |
| 116:25 | setbacks got from there to here you |
| 116:28 | aren't even as far into the red as I was |
| 116:30 | so all of the talk I I understand why |
| 116:33 | hustle Pon kind of gets a |
| 116:35 | cringe push back from the world but what |
| 116:38 | it actually should be is an unbelievably |
| 116:40 | empowering message that anybody can get |
| 116:42 | from wherever they are to wherever you |
| 116:45 | are the much more disempowering one was |
| 116:49 | yeah man it you know it just comes to me |
| 116:51 | easily so yeah if you really want to |
| 116:53 | [ __ ] somebody up tell them that it's |
| 116:56 | ineffable tell them that it's ethereal |
| 116:58 | and astral and you can't get |
| 117:02 | here one of my favorite ways to help |
| 117:05 | someone overcome an excuse or limiting |
| 117:08 | belief is to tell them I believe them |
| 117:12 | and so if I'm like hey why don't you |
| 117:13 | double your prices and then they give |
| 117:15 | four reasons why they can't double your |
| 117:17 | their prices and then I'll |
| 117:19 | say then you'll fail forever |
| 117:23 | and then they're like well no because X |
| 117:26 | Y and Z and it's like great glad we got |
| 117:29 | there that's like your thing about only |
| 117:31 | one person can be in the angry boat yeah |
| 117:33 | one person can only be in the negative |
| 117:35 | boat yeah it work it's unbelievable how |
| 117:37 | powerful that is |
| 117:42 | um what's interesting about a lot of the |
| 117:45 | discontent that we have around how |
| 117:47 | people judge our success or achievement |
| 117:52 | is that we have this unspoken demand |
| 117:56 | that they have a visceral understanding |
| 117:59 | of everything that we went through |
| 118:01 | without having been there and the |
| 118:03 | problem with that is that if they |
| 118:05 | understood everything then they would |
| 118:08 | have a complete understanding of how to |
| 118:10 | do it themselves and so it's making an |
| 118:12 | impossible demand of strangers to |
| 118:15 | somehow be successful already so that |
| 118:17 | they can appreciate our success it's |
| 118:19 | also removing your competitive advantage |
| 118:23 | and so it's interesting this is just for |
| 118:24 | everyone who's listening is that Chris |
| 118:26 | you can probably attest to this is that |
| 118:29 | um of the people that I've met in my |
| 118:31 | life who've been extremely successful at |
| 118:33 | any Endeavor there's this kind of and I |
| 118:36 | want to make a video about this but it's |
| 118:38 | what people say in the back room and |
| 118:40 | there are these common things that we |
| 118:42 | say to one another that other people |
| 118:46 | wouldn't believe so we're like they just |
| 118:48 | don't get how much actual work it is to |
| 118:52 | do a podcast like this PE like you don't |
| 118:55 | actually get that what 100 hours of |
| 118:59 | preparation for one 1 hour event looks |
| 119:01 | like you you can understand it |
| 119:03 | conceptually but when you actually set a |
| 119:06 | timer and you only use that timer and |
| 119:08 | you pause it when you stop working and |
| 119:10 | you do 100 hours of work all of a sudden |
| 119:13 | by the end of that 100 hours you have a |
| 119:15 | very different understanding to the very |
| 119:18 | granular level of |
| 119:22 | what it takes to be great at anything |
| 119:26 | and that's 100 hours not 10,000 hours |
| 119:27 | but 100 hours with feedback and |
| 119:30 | so everyone's like in the back room they |
| 119:34 | want this magic pill they want to they |
| 119:36 | want to know the secret but there is no |
| 119:37 | secret it's just hard work but I think |
| 119:39 | the thing that everyone who's who's |
| 119:41 | listening lacks is the context on how |
| 119:45 | hard hard work is not in that it's |
| 119:47 | complex but just in that it's a |
| 119:50 | continuous and unending Focus |
| 119:52 | on one thing and noticing the details |
| 119:55 | that separate mediocrity from greatness |
| 119:57 | and if you're like I don't know what the |
| 119:59 | difference between those two things is |
| 120:01 | that is the opportunity that hard work |
| 120:03 | reveals is that it takes |
| 120:06 | watching 10 hours of you presenting and |
| 120:09 | then taking notes at every time that you |
| 120:11 | say um or that a transition between |
| 120:13 | slides is unclean or that the audience |
| 120:16 | kind of gets lost there because I can |
| 120:17 | see that there's no reactions to that I |
| 120:19 | should probably add a visual there and |
| 120:20 | then when you go slide by slide |
| 120:22 | realizing that okay I can put a thousand |
| 120:25 | slides together for 90 minutes of |
| 120:28 | presenting if I really put one thought |
| 120:30 | with one visual per slide and every one |
| 120:33 | of them and I love this description is |
| 120:35 | like a coat of paint it's like you just |
| 120:37 | put another coat of paint on the skill |
| 120:39 | set or the achievement that you're |
| 120:40 | working towards and most people expect |
| 120:43 | that the pencil wireframe that they do |
| 120:46 | on their first shot is hard work because |
| 120:49 | that's the hardest they've worked not |
| 120:52 | the amount of hard work that is required |
| 120:55 | in order to get the level of outcome |
| 120:59 | that they say they want or that they |
| 121:00 | expect and so there's a divorce in |
| 121:04 | reality because they don't have the |
| 121:05 | context from which to make a judgment |
| 121:07 | because they've never been great at |
| 121:08 | anything and until you get great because |
| 121:11 | as soon as you get great at one thing |
| 121:13 | you realize just the tremendous amount |
| 121:16 | of hours and work that it takes to be |
| 121:18 | great at one thing and then there's this |
| 121:20 | oh [ __ ] moment that I can express |
| 121:21 | personally which is you realize that |
| 121:22 | there's so few things that you can be |
| 121:24 | great at and then the discipline comes |
| 121:26 | down to saying what are the two or three |
| 121:28 | things that I can be really good at in |
| 121:29 | my life because it will take me five to |
| 121:32 | seven years to be exceptional at this |
| 121:33 | one thing and so like even like making |
| 121:36 | content a lot of people see my stuff now |
| 121:38 | but I just had a friend send me a video |
| 121:41 | that he interviewed me before I made any |
| 121:44 | other videos and I showed I sent it to |
| 121:45 | my team and uh he was like dude I I |
| 121:49 | watched it and he was like and it was |
| 121:50 | you but then I like I covered the face |
| 121:53 | and it he was like I mean it's your |
| 121:55 | voice but he's like your Clarity of |
| 121:57 | thinking wasn't there in the way that |
| 121:58 | you articulated and the thing is is it's |
| 122:01 | it's uh if to the untrained eye to a |
| 122:05 | beginner they look at that video and |
| 122:07 | they look at my current videos and say I |
| 122:09 | don't get why he blew up because it's |
| 122:11 | the same dude but the master or the |
| 122:15 | expert level can say I can give you a |
| 122:17 | hundred different things that could have |
| 122:19 | been better about his now or his old |
| 122:23 | videos compared to his Now videos and |
| 122:25 | it's the granularity of that feedback |
| 122:27 | that allows you to see the discrepancy |
| 122:29 | between your current and you're desired |
| 122:31 | and I think that once |
| 122:34 | you actually give yourself the reality |
| 122:36 | glasses not the wo is me glasses but |
| 122:38 | think no really if I had to do this what |
| 122:41 | are what are all of the things that I |
| 122:43 | would have to improve then you see how |
| 122:45 | incredibly long that list is and then |
| 122:48 | you take this deep breath and that list |
| 122:51 | is the hard work it's starting at the |
| 122:54 | top and then wanting to cross the first |
| 122:57 | one off after your first day but then |
| 122:59 | realizing you still haven't done it well |
| 123:00 | enough to cross it off and you're like |
| 123:02 | wait I have to do another day and I |
| 123:03 | still haven't quote made a dent in this |
| 123:05 | list and then you do it another day and |
| 123:07 | a third day and a fifth day and a fifth |
| 123:09 | week and then all of a sudden you're |
| 123:10 | like okay I think I've got the first one |
| 123:12 | done and then you still look at this |
| 123:14 | list but along the way of doing that |
| 123:16 | first one you realize 20 other things |
| 123:18 | that you could add to that list for |
| 123:19 | every one that you cross off you create |
| 123:22 | 10 more because you start to win in the |
| 123:23 | weeds you start to look at a higher |
| 123:27 | resolution and that's the never ending |
| 123:30 | cycle of |
| 123:34 | Excellence it makes great things |
| 123:38 | seem closer than you thought and further |
| 123:40 | than you thought at the same time same |
| 123:41 | time |
| 123:43 | 100% there's no perfect way to live your |
| 123:46 | 20s you either live them up and become |
| 123:49 | an unders skilled 30-year-old or you |
| 123:51 | work come up and become an underlied |
| 123:53 | 30-year-old you just have to figure out |
| 123:55 | which you'd rather be accept the |
| 123:57 | tradeoffs and know that there are no |
| 124:00 | doovers and door |
| 124:03 | three if you |
| 124:05 | consider work life then you get to do |
| 124:11 | both that one ruffled a lot of |
| 124:14 | feathers wa because people look back on |
| 124:17 | the 20s and realize that they are one or |
| 124:19 | the other all right I'm I'm going to |
| 124:21 | lean into |
| 124:23 | this |
| 124:26 | I I am okay I had a conversation with my |
| 124:29 | team about this and I said I am okay |
| 124:31 | being a beacon |
| 124:34 | of Relentless hard work I'm okay being |
| 124:37 | the guy who says [ __ ] your mental health |
| 124:40 | I'm okay with it because I've given it a |
| 124:42 | lot of thought I think that there is the |
| 124:44 | other side is wildly over represented |
| 124:47 | and I'm willing to sit on the logical |
| 124:49 | extreme because I think it will help |
| 124:50 | more people |
| 124:53 | and there are more people that I have |
| 124:56 | met in my life who are dissatisfied by |
| 124:59 | their Live It Up 20s then dissatisfied |
| 125:03 | by their work it up 20s because most of |
| 125:05 | the time in your 20s you have no idea |
| 125:07 | what you want but knowing what you need |
| 125:10 | to do to work and move ahead is fairly |
| 125:12 | straightforward and so you can take the |
| 125:14 | known and make progress on the one that |
| 125:17 | you have high confidence that you can |
| 125:18 | make progress on and then along the way |
| 125:21 | gain perspective Ive on what are the |
| 125:22 | things that are actually important to |
| 125:24 | you in your life and you may find out |
| 125:26 | often that they're far fewer of those |
| 125:28 | things than you really originally |
| 125:29 | thought because what you thought live |
| 125:31 | them up in your 20s was was actually |
| 125:33 | your mom and your two homies who are |
| 125:35 | both mediocre and you don't care about |
| 125:37 | their opinion now when you're 30 anyways |
| 125:39 | but what a waste of a life it would have |
| 125:41 | been to quote live up your mom's dream |
| 125:44 | or your friend's dreams to then only get |
| 125:47 | to your 30s and realize you didn't live |
| 125:49 | it up and you also didn't work it up and |
| 125:52 | now you have |
| 125:59 | neither I think a lot about you |
| 126:03 | know the first day that I sat down at |
| 126:06 | University my first ever seminar I sat |
| 126:08 | next to my what would be future business |
| 126:09 | partner for 15 years so I'm skinned I |
| 126:12 | say to him I've spent all of my money |
| 126:14 | partying during Fresh's week the first |
| 126:16 | week I'd spent my entire maintenance |
| 126:19 | loan which was supposed to be food and |
| 126:20 | everything else for the of the term |
| 126:22 | until [ __ ] Christmas and it's |
| 126:24 | September the 29th it a big week it it |
| 126:27 | was a good week um which I could not |
| 126:31 | survive now |
| 126:32 | and I think uh I think back to sort of |
| 126:36 | the the time that I spent |
| 126:39 | and the endless hours I'm not kidding |
| 126:43 | and I don't talk I I don't reflect that |
| 126:46 | much on the the club promo stuff maybe |
| 126:48 | to my detriment I should do it more uh |
| 126:51 | I've spent between 5 and 10,000 hours |
| 126:53 | stood on the front door of |
| 126:55 | nightclubs I've spent at least 3,000 |
| 126:59 | hours stood on the front door of the |
| 127:00 | same nightclub only on |
| 127:03 | Saturdays right I didn't miss |
| 127:07 | 202 Saturdays in a row I took four day |
| 127:10 | holidays from Sunday to Thursday so that |
| 127:12 | I could come back to come and do this |
| 127:13 | thing and I look back at my 20s and I |
| 127:15 | think you know was that how much was |
| 127:17 | living how much was accumulating skills |
| 127:20 | and The Grass Is Always was greener with |
| 127:22 | this because in hindsight you think well |
| 127:23 | you know you imagine that you could have |
| 127:26 | gone back and still accumulated all of |
| 127:29 | the insights and the skills that you |
| 127:31 | really value in yourself that would have |
| 127:33 | still happened but that you would have |
| 127:35 | got to maybe have more variety or you |
| 127:37 | would have maybe the fun or the whatever |
| 127:39 | the thing and uh when I look for me with |
| 127:43 | my Constitution at what I value most in |
| 127:46 | myself almost all of those things have |
| 127:48 | been accumulated by having a 20s and now |
| 127:51 | a 30s that has been dedicated to work it |
| 127:55 | up not to Liv it up to 4-day holidays in |
| 127:59 | between those things |
| 128:01 | now remembering that now is not forever |
| 128:04 | I think is really important again you're |
| 128:07 | on the outlier right hand end of the |
| 128:10 | distribution for work most people are |
| 128:12 | going to pull themselves back across in |
| 128:14 | terms of balance between work and play |
| 128:17 | but you can periodize what you're doing |
| 128:20 | right now |
| 128:23 | you can accumulate all of that work all |
| 128:25 | of that experience all of that explore |
| 128:27 | time to work out actually I don't like |
| 128:28 | doing admin stuff it turns out I'm |
| 128:30 | really great at creative or I really |
| 128:31 | don't like traveling it turns out I'm |
| 128:33 | really great at routine all of those |
| 128:34 | things there's like a buyin you remember |
| 128:36 | CrossFit you do the you do a buyin thing |
| 128:38 | you it's a one mile run and then it's |
| 128:40 | this workout you have to do that buyin |
| 128:42 | let's say everyone has to do that buyin |
| 128:44 | doing that buyin when you're 25 is way |
| 128:46 | easier than doing that buying when |
| 128:47 | you're 40 right I finally work out who I |
| 128:51 | am in the the world because you start to |
| 128:52 | accumulate all of these better |
| 128:54 | directional assistances you're moving in |
| 128:56 | a more directionally accurate way |
| 128:58 | earlier which means that you make more |
| 128:59 | progress over the long term so in |
| 129:02 | retrospect I'm glad that I did work it |
| 129:04 | up 20s and I'm glad that I did work it |
| 129:06 | up 30s as |
| 129:07 | well so I'll say two two things that |
| 129:10 | might be helpful um one is you obviously |
| 129:15 | know my stance if you're listening to |
| 129:16 | this on work life balance |
| 129:18 | but maybe as a as a concession for you |
| 129:22 | your work life balance Obsession may |
| 129:25 | just |
| 129:26 | be too narrowly focused on the present |
| 129:32 | and not extended into seasons and so you |
| 129:35 | can have work life balance where I work |
| 129:37 | for three years and then I have a more |
| 129:39 | chill year and I think that most people |
| 129:41 | think about work life in terms of their |
| 129:44 | split of the day rather than their split |
| 129:46 | of the year or the decade and I think |
| 129:48 | that you can have a much better outcome |
| 129:50 | on both sides es if you were to split it |
| 129:52 | up on a longer time Horizon so good I |
| 129:55 | mean everybody knows what it's like to |
| 129:58 | go through it every January intense |
| 130:01 | period of diet I [ __ ] it at Christmas |
| 130:03 | again too much chocolate too much too |
| 130:05 | much dinner |
| 130:07 | and you go okay well what are you going |
| 130:10 | to do I'm going to work hard I'm going |
| 130:12 | to focus on my diet and my training for |
| 130:13 | a while and then I'm going to hold those |
| 130:15 | gains for a period or I'm going to build |
| 130:18 | a business okay my Health's probably |
| 130:19 | going to take a hit for a little while |
| 130:21 | or or I just got out of a relationship I |
| 130:22 | need to go dating all right well I'm |
| 130:23 | probably not going to be able to spend |
| 130:24 | so much time at work or maybe I'm going |
| 130:26 | to be sleeping later so my my fitness is |
| 130:27 | going to knock off a little bit all of |
| 130:30 | these things happen for periods of time |
| 130:33 | and yeah remembering that now isn't |
| 130:35 | forever |
| 130:36 | is and that's such a great frame like a |
| 130:40 | hyperbolic discounting and inability to |
| 130:42 | be able to imagine that this is not the |
| 130:43 | way that it's always going to be and |
| 130:46 | that's |
| 130:47 | good for good things and for bad things |
| 130:49 | this isn't the way it's always going to |
| 130:50 | be so bet enjoy this win this isn't the |
| 130:53 | way it's always going to be so I better |
| 130:54 | not get too disheartened by this loss |
| 130:57 | you will come back that's the the |
| 130:58 | beautiful thing about this sort of uh |
| 131:00 | honic renormalizing they go good things |
| 131:03 | aren't as good as you think they are bad |
| 131:05 | things aren't as bad as you think they |
| 131:06 | are so if you if you use that extended |
| 131:09 | frame as a way to approach different |
| 131:11 | types of goals so I'll break a very |
| 131:13 | standard one which is that people |
| 131:14 | measure the amount of calories that they |
| 131:16 | need to eat per day but very few people |
| 131:18 | measure the amount of calories they need |
| 131:19 | to eat per week and so people will blow |
| 131:23 | the day and say well screw it I messed |
| 131:24 | up today I might as well have a pizza on |
| 131:26 | top of it because I had chocolate and I |
| 131:27 | went off my diet or whatever but if you |
| 131:30 | have a weekly Outlook even then all of a |
| 131:32 | sudden you're like oh well I can have a |
| 131:33 | pizza tonight I'll just like skip most |
| 131:35 | of my food tomorrow besides protein or |
| 131:38 | I'll have a wedding weekend and know |
| 131:40 | that this whole week I'm going to be |
| 131:41 | light and so I have you know 13,000 |
| 131:45 | calories for the next seven days that I |
| 131:47 | can work my way through which gives me a |
| 131:49 | tremendous amount of flexibility MH and |
| 131:51 | the thing is is that the further you |
| 131:52 | extend the time Horizon the more |
| 131:54 | flexible you can be with your |
| 131:55 | achievement of it as long as you only |
| 131:56 | get the few things that matter most and |
| 131:58 | so it allows you to focus and prioritize |
| 132:00 | on those few things that move the needle |
| 132:03 | rather than be overly obsessive on such |
| 132:06 | a small narrow window of time that is |
| 132:09 | irrelevant anyways so there's a there's |
| 132:11 | a coordination problem that happens when |
| 132:14 | you try to balance too quickly when you |
| 132:16 | try to have a little bit of fun and a |
| 132:18 | little bit of play and a little bit of |
| 132:19 | fun and a little bit of play whe whether |
| 132:21 | it's task switching whether it's just |
| 132:22 | sort of the cognitive effort of uh your |
| 132:25 | personality like your identity is I'm |
| 132:28 | gym guy for three months hooray I'm work |
| 132:30 | guy for three months hooray but when |
| 132:32 | it's I'm gym guy this morning I'm work |
| 132:34 | guy this afternoon it's tough it's tough |
| 132:36 | to do that so yeah kind of the same as |
| 132:38 | you get dis economies of scale as a |
| 132:40 | business grows because there's more |
| 132:41 | interconnectedness and communication |
| 132:43 | between each person the more use there |
| 132:45 | are going on inside so this is an |
| 132:47 | argument for sort of aggressive |
| 132:49 | periodizing I'm uh hyper proponent of |
| 132:53 | one single narrow |
| 132:55 | Focus I'll Define two more terms since |
| 132:58 | the audience didn't ask for |
| 133:01 | it sadness is a perceived lack of |
| 133:04 | options it's why it feels like |
| 133:06 | hopelessness because you don't know what |
| 133:07 | to do you don't know what options are |
| 133:10 | available you see none which is why it |
| 133:12 | feels like there's no way out anxiety is |
| 133:15 | many options but no priorities which is |
| 133:17 | why you feel scattered but you can't |
| 133:19 | decide they feel very different but |
| 133:21 | fundamentally those are the difference |
| 133:22 | in the conditions that make people feel |
| 133:25 | like they're anxious or they feel like |
| 133:27 | they're sad and so when we're working |
| 133:30 | through what you were just talking about |
| 133:32 | with okay I want to be gym guy and I |
| 133:34 | also want to be work guy we have many |
| 133:37 | options but a lack of priorities and so |
| 133:38 | we have anxiety over the fact that we're |
| 133:40 | not making progress on any of them |
| 133:42 | because we have not been able to say |
| 133:44 | this comes first so if we think about |
| 133:46 | what priority means it means prior it |
| 133:48 | comes before everything else and what I |
| 133:50 | think a lot of people have a hard time |
| 133:52 | doing is being okay with saying no and |
| 133:56 | saying okay I will allow myself to just |
| 134:01 | not get fatter rather than get fitter |
| 134:04 | during this period and what's |
| 134:06 | interesting about most skills is that |
| 134:09 | the amount of effort that it takes to |
| 134:10 | maintain a skill versus the amount of |
| 134:12 | effort it takes to grow a skill is like |
| 134:15 | on10th the amount of effort and so this |
| 134:18 | is where the effort Arbitrage is so |
| 134:20 | important an in terms of allocation and |
| 134:22 | so if you do a four out of 10 on 10 |
| 134:26 | things you will make progress on none |
| 134:28 | you will make the same amount of |
| 134:29 | progress that you could have made if you |
| 134:30 | just did one out of 10 which is none you |
| 134:33 | just don't regress but the extra three |
| 134:35 | points that you save on the nine you |
| 134:37 | could put on one other item and have a |
| 134:40 | 10 out of 10 or a 13 out of 10 in effort |
| 134:43 | and then after every periodized chunk of |
| 134:45 | time have a Big W or win that you can |
| 134:48 | look back on and say I did that and |
| 134:50 | therefore I am and so I think that |
| 134:54 | that's how you step up the mountain of |
| 134:56 | progress when you're trying to work on |
| 134:59 | many different skills quote at the same |
| 135:01 | time it's just that the at the same time |
| 135:03 | is over a year not over a day George |
| 135:06 | told me told me this while we were on |
| 135:07 | mushrooms in Nashville [ __ ] brilliant |
| 135:10 | so I'm there watching the |
| 135:13 | hook got got to get people in the door |
| 135:15 | yeah I'm there Fourth of July George |
| 135:18 | turned to me and he said General |
| 135:20 | ambition gives you anxiety specific |
| 135:22 | ambition gives you Direction there is |
| 135:25 | nothing more anxiety inducing than I |
| 135:28 | want to be better and I don't know what |
| 135:30 | at and I don't know |
| 135:32 | how like just think about that for a |
| 135:34 | second sort of embodi that I I it it's |
| 135:37 | sort of a chasing it's a lean in and |
| 135:39 | it's it's tight and sort of your |
| 135:40 | shoulders are up and there's a ringing |
| 135:41 | in your ears and you have no idea it's |
| 135:44 | like a threat you've heard a noise in |
| 135:46 | the forest and you have no idea where |
| 135:47 | it's come from specific ambition gives |
| 135:49 | you Direction and I think the concept of |
| 135:52 | specific versus General ambition ladders |
| 135:54 | up to bundled terms I want this big |
| 135:57 | thing but I haven't broken that thing |
| 135:59 | down into what I can actually do once |
| 136:01 | you get specific into the actions you |
| 136:02 | don't have a lot of anxiety because you |
| 136:04 | can see what is required in order to get |
| 136:06 | it and so to circle the loop back on |
| 136:09 | sadness which is because some people who |
| 136:11 | are listening to this may be sad so this |
| 136:12 | is for |
| 136:13 | you to get out of sadness and I've been |
| 136:16 | sad many times in my life the thing |
| 136:19 | that's helped me get out of it is |
| 136:21 | realizing that a perceived lack of |
| 136:24 | options is what causes sadness not a |
| 136:26 | lack of options a perceived lack of |
| 136:28 | options which means that all I have to |
| 136:30 | do is figure out what I need to do and |
| 136:34 | figuring it out becomes the option and |
| 136:36 | so then I have Clarity on the one thing |
| 136:39 | that I need to do to pull myself out of |
| 136:41 | this moment of sadness which is oh I |
| 136:44 | just have to figure out what to do and |
| 136:46 | that is how I get at least for me have |
| 136:48 | gotten out of my sder periods |
| 136:51 | controversial take you really can solve |
| 136:54 | a lot of male Problems by getting in |
| 136:55 | shape and making money you still have |
| 136:57 | problems they're just smaller and you |
| 136:59 | have more resources to handle them the |
| 137:02 | world is there for the taking for anyone |
| 137:04 | who can learn from their mistakes do |
| 137:06 | what they say they were going to do and |
| 137:08 | stick with it even if it's not sexy what |
| 137:11 | used to make a man acceptable now makes |
| 137:13 | you extraordinary the Batha winning has |
| 137:15 | never been so low show me two groups of |
| 137:20 | men that need to learn a new skill or |
| 137:23 | achieve anything where the men that are |
| 137:25 | in shape and have learned to make money |
| 137:29 | do worse than an identical group of |
| 137:31 | those men who are out of shape and have |
| 137:34 | not learned to make money and it's a |
| 137:36 | it's a skewed purposefully test because |
| 137:39 | the skill of getting in shape requires |
| 137:41 | many other skills the skill of making |
| 137:43 | money has many other sub skills and so |
| 137:46 | the real question is give me a group of |
| 137:48 | more skilled men and less skilled men |
| 137:50 | and and I promise you the more skilled |
| 137:52 | men will do better and so for anyone who |
| 137:54 | gets offended by that you're a [ __ ] and |
| 137:56 | so the idea is all men and |
| 138:02 | women benefit from learning more skills |
| 138:06 | there's no world where being more |
| 138:07 | skilled hurts you what about the bffa |
| 138:10 | winning is never been solo |
| 138:20 | if you think back to college when you |
| 138:22 | were a freshman you think wow this is so |
| 138:25 | hard or whatever and then by the time |
| 138:26 | you're a senior like man these kids are |
| 138:29 | so soft and so we remember things as |
| 138:31 | harder than they were but I also think |
| 138:34 | that there is a thread of reality which |
| 138:36 | is that the younger generation is softer |
| 138:39 | and I think we are softer than the |
| 138:41 | generation above us when I think about |
| 138:43 | the guys who were storming Normandy and |
| 138:44 | I think about the people who' be |
| 138:46 | attempting to do that now as a class I |
| 138:49 | think that we are softer |
| 138:51 | and so the thing is is that if you can |
| 138:54 | barely decide to take any action at all |
| 138:57 | and peel your eyes away from your phone |
| 138:59 | for just a moment it's so much easier to |
| 139:02 | beat everyone else |
| 139:05 | because most people are overweight |
| 139:08 | they're distracted they're poor they |
| 139:10 | have so few skills because it has never |
| 139:14 | been easier to start a business to make |
| 139:17 | money to get in shape |
| 139:21 | it's just also never been easier to do |
| 139:27 | nothing and so in a world where it's |
| 139:31 | never been easier to do nothing doing |
| 139:33 | something becomes |
| 139:34 | extraordinary yeah the bar genuinely |
| 139:37 | never has been so low which is it really |
| 139:39 | does blow my mind sort of the |
| 139:41 | self-defeating |
| 139:43 | cynicism mindset and I think also that's |
| 139:46 | why the idea of the Lonely chapter |
| 139:48 | resonates so much with people because |
| 139:53 | it it literally is like taking the red |
| 139:55 | pill if you see this version of the |
| 139:57 | world where you |
| 139:59 | go I can impact my |
| 140:02 | outcomes I can learn a thing apply a |
| 140:05 | thing and then I change as a byproduct |
| 140:08 | of doing that as soon as you take those |
| 140:10 | steps you |
| 140:12 | realize almost all of the people around |
| 140:14 | you who have parts of their life that |
| 140:17 | they're not happy about are kind of |
| 140:19 | making a choice for it to be that way |
| 140:22 | now it may be an uninformed or an |
| 140:24 | ignorant choice because they haven't |
| 140:25 | taken said |
| 140:27 | pill and then you go oh [ __ ] that means |
| 140:31 | that all of the things I don't like |
| 140:32 | about me and I don't like about my life |
| 140:34 | are my responsibility because I can |
| 140:36 | change |
| 140:37 | it but given that you've got generalized |
| 140:40 | cynicism |
| 140:42 | everywhere as opposed to thinking I'm |
| 140:45 | despondent this sucks I wish wish that |
| 140:47 | the world was more hopeful you can still |
| 140:49 | think that and also go so that means |
| 140:52 | that my competition has never been |
| 140:53 | weaker more vulnerable more |
| 140:57 | Fragile the ability to set myself out |
| 141:00 | from the pack has never been |
| 141:02 | easier I think people struggle a lot |
| 141:05 | with the concept that something can be |
| 141:07 | both painful and |
| 141:09 | empowering it's this hurts therefore |
| 141:11 | it's bad when taking full accountability |
| 141:15 | of your life with all of the |
| 141:17 | deficiencies that you have may be the |
| 141:19 | most painful thing that you do when you |
| 141:20 | look yourself in the mirror and say this |
| 141:21 | is my |
| 141:23 | fault but in saying this is my fault |
| 141:27 | those are also the first two steps of |
| 141:28 | progress because it's my fault not |
| 141:31 | anyone else's which means it's my |
| 141:33 | responsibility and my action that can |
| 141:34 | change that and I think that marrying |
| 141:38 | short-term pain with long-term progress |
| 141:40 | is one of the first connections that |
| 141:42 | most people who are on that path have to |
| 141:44 | make this is the lead indicator of what |
| 141:46 | will be the lag indicator that I |
| 141:48 | want people get frustrated not achieving |
| 141:52 | what they want because they assume that |
| 141:53 | they're going to jump across a cavern in |
| 141:55 | one Leap but if you picture your goals |
| 141:59 | like you're trying to build a bridge |
| 142:00 | across that crevice and every brick that |
| 142:04 | you put on that bridge is progress and |
| 142:07 | each one of those bricks represents a |
| 142:09 | skill that you need to learn along the |
| 142:10 | way it just takes all the way until you |
| 142:13 | get to the other side that you can |
| 142:14 | actually walk across and so the walking |
| 142:17 | across is the outcome it's the external |
| 142:19 | perceived achievement but if you can |
| 142:22 | reframe your progress as what are the |
| 142:25 | hundred things on this checklist what |
| 142:27 | are the hundred skills that I need the |
| 142:29 | micro skills that I need then you can |
| 142:30 | have much faster feedback cycles of wins |
| 142:33 | that you're achieving along the way and |
| 142:35 | I think if you can Define it that way |
| 142:36 | then you can feel like you are winning a |
| 142:39 | more often but B with higher intensity |
| 142:42 | because as you win skills stack on top |
| 142:45 | of each other and so I give this example |
| 142:47 | a lot but I like it is that |
| 142:50 | if you are you learned how to do math |
| 142:53 | that's a skill great if you then learn |
| 142:57 | how to do accounting that's a leveled up |
| 142:59 | version of that skill but you require |
| 143:01 | you have to know how to do math before |
| 143:02 | you can do |
| 143:03 | accounting once you learn how to do |
| 143:06 | accounting you can learn how to do |
| 143:09 | transactions and structure deals and |
| 143:11 | then all of a sudden you can become a |
| 143:13 | CFO and if you learn how taxes work and |
| 143:17 | insurance work then all of a sudden you |
| 143:19 | become and and you learn how to raise |
| 143:21 | money all of a sudden you can be a rain |
| 143:22 | maker but the thing is is that the gap |
| 143:25 | between rain maker and I know how to do |
| 143:27 | math feels very big but if you look at |
| 143:29 | all of the micro things along the way |
| 143:30 | you might not get your first major deal |
| 143:32 | done which is what everyone in the man |
| 143:34 | he did that deal and made $20 million on |
| 143:38 | one signature must be nice right and it |
| 143:41 | is |
| 143:42 | uh but if you if you break those things |
| 143:46 | down into the into the the requisite |
| 143:47 | skills then you can make significantly |
| 143:49 | more progress along the way and I think |
| 143:50 | that is more positively reinforcing and |
| 143:52 | I'm just I'm sharing this because this |
| 143:53 | has been a perspective that has served |
| 143:55 | me so well in my life because the goals |
| 143:58 | that I have now take many years to come |
| 144:01 | to fruition like I'm I'm working in a |
| 144:03 | goal that in the next probably 18 months |
| 144:05 | I will have been working on for 13 years |
| 144:07 | and it will it will probably come du and |
| 144:11 | the crazy thing is is that the bigger |
| 144:12 | your goal the bigger your timeline has |
| 144:14 | to be but the the even crazier thing is |
| 144:17 | that the bigger your timeline the EAS it |
| 144:20 | is if I said you just have you have to |
| 144:23 | learn French and you don't speak French |
| 144:26 | and you have to do it by tomorrow it's |
| 144:28 | impossible you're not going to do it |
| 144:29 | there's no way that you're going to be |
| 144:30 | able to do it but if I said you have to |
| 144:31 | learn in a decade you're like oh I could |
| 144:33 | I could easily do it you could probably |
| 144:35 | learn 10 languages in a decade and so |
| 144:37 | all of a sudden the goals that you have |
| 144:39 | can be significantly more achievable and |
| 144:41 | you can feel like you're consistently |
| 144:42 | making progress by moving out your |
| 144:43 | timeline but because people are so |
| 144:45 | short-term minded because they can't |
| 144:47 | just stop scrolling over and over again |
| 144:49 | they actually make it harder for them to |
| 144:51 | achieve their goals because the only |
| 144:52 | goals that they deem acceptable are ones |
| 144:54 | that are on an unrealistic timeline and |
| 144:56 | so they doom themselves from the |
| 144:59 | beginning how to avoid tons of problems |
| 145:02 | in life go to bed on |
| 145:05 | time so I love |
| 145:09 | these I want to find single behaviors |
| 145:12 | that have many positive outcomes so if |
| 145:15 | you think about leverage as what you get |
| 145:17 | for the effort you put in if you have |
| 145:19 | lots of Leverage then it means you can |
| 145:20 | do one thing and get many big outcomes |
| 145:22 | right or one very big outcome that's |
| 145:23 | high leverage if you put a lot of work |
| 145:25 | in and get a very little bit out of it |
| 145:26 | you have low leverage and so the highest |
| 145:28 | form of Leverage I think of are what's |
| 145:31 | one Behavior or one skill that I can |
| 145:33 | learn that then has many many Downstream |
| 145:36 | impacts and so for and this is |
| 145:38 | specifically I'll say for the the 20ish |
| 145:41 | year old so 20 to 30 20 to |
| 145:43 | 35 if you can simply go to bed on |
| 145:47 | time you avoid drinking and getting in a |
| 145:51 | DUI you avoid early pregnancies you |
| 145:54 | avoid missing messing up your work |
| 145:57 | because you don't sleep well because uh |
| 145:59 | you show up hung over the next day and |
| 146:01 | then you don't get the career |
| 146:02 | advancement that you want or you get the |
| 146:03 | judgments from your co-workers from the |
| 146:05 | fact that you're responsible because you |
| 146:07 | drink even though it might have been |
| 146:08 | responsible drinking but you still smell |
| 146:09 | like booze because it's in your |
| 146:11 | system if you go to bed on |
| 146:14 | time it's less likely that you'll get |
| 146:16 | mugged it's less likely you'll be in a |
| 146:18 | car AC like there's there's all of these |
| 146:20 | Downstream impacts from one single |
| 146:22 | behavior and you also have better |
| 146:25 | quality sleep in general if you go to |
| 146:26 | sleep at the same time every day over |
| 146:28 | and over again so that means that you |
| 146:29 | have life extension things that happen |
| 146:31 | you look younger and so now 5 years 10 |
| 146:33 | years later people are like wow you look |
| 146:35 | so good for your age there's all of |
| 146:36 | these things from one Central Behavior |
| 146:39 | which is just [ __ ] go to bed on time |
| 146:42 | and so if you want the action for this |
| 146:45 | you set your alarm for when you go to |
| 146:46 | bed not for when you wake up if you set |
| 146:48 | your alarm for when you go to bed you |
| 146:50 | will always be able to wake up naturally |
| 146:51 | whatever you time you wake up and it's |
| 146:53 | very difficult to oversleep when you go |
| 146:55 | to bed at 9:00 because you can get 8 |
| 146:57 | hours of sleep and still be up by |
| 147:00 | five what are some of the other |
| 147:02 | behaviors that fit in that category do |
| 147:04 | you think oh the the the mega bang |
| 147:06 | behaviors |
| 147:09 | M give you one that A friend gave me one |
| 147:12 | thing uh buying a dog with his so um |
| 147:16 | externalizing your sense of self having |
| 147:20 | something which gives you unconditional |
| 147:21 | love uh your step count has just |
| 147:24 | quadrupled at least uh there is a sort |
| 147:28 | of degree of um responsibility it's sort |
| 147:32 | of early |
| 147:33 | onset furry child rearing that makes you |
| 147:36 | a better parent in future just |
| 147:38 | Downstream from this one |
| 147:40 | decision an in essentially infinite |
| 147:42 | number of good things happen are you |
| 147:44 | gritting at before my team's smiling |
| 147:46 | because they know that there's probably |
| 147:47 | like one thing that I tell everyone not |
| 147:49 | to do get a dog yeah wow why don't you |
| 147:52 | want them to get a dog so I think that |
| 147:54 | getting a dog for the reasons that you |
| 147:55 | outlined makes sense for living life |
| 147:59 | satisfaction like if you don't walk |
| 148:02 | walking a dog is a good thing if I |
| 148:03 | already walk I don't get that benefit if |
| 148:07 | I have interpersonal relationships and |
| 148:09 | an outside version awareness of self |
| 148:12 | then I don't necessarily get the benefit |
| 148:14 | but there are significant costs to |
| 148:16 | having a dog which for me from a making |
| 148:19 | money perspect perspective because that |
| 148:21 | is the game that I like to play uh it |
| 148:23 | costs a lot Dogs cost a tremendous |
| 148:25 | amount and so they cost you not being |
| 148:28 | able to go to events they cost you |
| 148:30 | having to break up in the middle of the |
| 148:32 | day to go home to let the dog out they |
| 148:34 | cost actual money uh the amount of total |
| 148:37 | time that you spend walking the dog if |
| 148:40 | you already work out is most of the time |
| 148:42 | just wasted now you could say hey I'm |
| 148:44 | listening to a podcast fine but if it |
| 148:46 | but it will interrupt deep work for the |
| 148:48 | most part and so I uh so to give you |
| 148:51 | context on how extreme I am about this |
| 148:53 | uh Leila uh bought a dog and then I uh |
| 148:57 | got her to give it away uh what sort of |
| 148:59 | dog was it King Charles um spaniel the |
| 149:02 | little nice strong British dog very yeah |
| 149:06 | super nice dog nothing wrong with the |
| 149:08 | dog good dude racist decision yes and so |
| 149:11 | I uh we just gave it to somebody else in |
| 149:13 | a good home and it's very happy and you |
| 149:15 | know what it probably forgot about me |
| 149:18 | instantly what else what some of these |
| 149:20 | other Big B I mean there's obviously the |
| 149:22 | exercise because like if you think about |
| 149:23 | what are the what are the big things |
| 149:24 | that because the dog one was Downstream |
| 149:27 | from I mean for me a big one there is |
| 149:29 | exercise like if you walk or two it's |
| 149:32 | like physical and psychological Health |
| 149:33 | basically yeah so it has multiple there |
| 149:35 | um I would |
| 149:38 | say eating your body weight in grams of |
| 149:41 | protein per |
| 149:43 | day so if we think about uh lean body |
| 149:46 | mass is one of the big predictors for |
| 149:48 | long-term health and things like that |
| 149:50 | um there are only three things that are |
| 149:53 | anabolic hormones resistance |
| 149:56 | training and protein like if someone |
| 149:59 | doesn't eat protein and they start |
| 150:01 | eating protein they have more muscle |
| 150:02 | like you don't have to exercise if you |
| 150:03 | just eat more protein you gain muscle |
| 150:05 | because you have you lose less muscle |
| 150:06 | because more of it comes from your diet |
| 150:07 | than eating away of the muscle you |
| 150:11 | have that's it like those are the three |
| 150:13 | things and so like you can do one of |
| 150:14 | them and the nice thing |
| 150:18 | is for most people who want to |
| 150:20 | operationalize this there's this big |
| 150:22 | idea and I'm not going to get into food |
| 150:23 | and fitness stuff cuz dear God |
| 150:27 | but people think I have to eat healthy |
| 150:30 | and it's this big amorphous thing but if |
| 150:32 | we chunk it down it means that you need |
| 150:34 | to pick two things that you like to eat |
| 150:36 | in the morning that have the macros that |
| 150:38 | you need to hit and you can try as many |
| 150:40 | times as you want because you only need |
| 150:42 | one or two that you actually like and |
| 150:44 | then you can stick with it this is one |
| 150:45 | of the best insights that you had about |
| 150:47 | diet which is people over comp okay |
| 150:50 | trying to deconstruct what a diet |
| 150:52 | consists of but if you actually look at |
| 150:54 | what you eat across a year it's probably |
| 150:57 | five meals on rotation maybe less I |
| 150:59 | think I've probably got three good meals |
| 151:02 | in my locker you know my my Gordon |
| 151:04 | Ramsey would be [ __ ] ashamed of |
| 151:06 | coming from the same country so okay we |
| 151:08 | just optimize those three meals or those |
| 151:10 | five meals and that's it and the thing |
| 151:13 | is is that a lot of personal development |
| 151:16 | things business things are a lot like |
| 151:18 | that where they feel like an elephant |
| 151:20 | when you are trying to trying to break |
| 151:21 | down this math like I have to learn |
| 151:23 | nutrition I have to there's five meals |
| 151:26 | 10 meals Max that you eat 90% of the |
| 151:29 | time you just need to shift the dynamic |
| 151:31 | of those meals even the restaurants that |
| 151:33 | you go to even the way that you order |
| 151:34 | your food in the |
| 151:36 | restaurants that's it and so that would |
| 151:39 | be one that I would say is a super high |
| 151:42 | leverage one thing you can do is just |
| 151:45 | change the three to five meals that you |
| 151:47 | eat most commonly to be the ones that |
| 151:49 | are Mor Ed with what you want and go to |
| 151:52 | bed on time and go to bed I mean shoot |
| 151:53 | if you go to bed on time and you do that |
| 151:56 | king of the world king of the |
| 151:57 | world uh this is one from me having a |
| 152:01 | clue is overrated there's this funny |
| 152:03 | myth that people actually know what |
| 152:04 | they're doing I've spent time around |
| 152:06 | some of the richest smartest highest |
| 152:08 | status people on the planet and let me |
| 152:09 | tell you it's idiots all the way up |
| 152:12 | normalize saying I don't have a clue I'm |
| 152:16 | going to work out how to do it anyway |
| 152:18 | having a clue is overrated |
| 152:21 | one of my green flags for intellect is |
| 152:24 | someone being able to say that they |
| 152:25 | don't |
| 152:28 | know |
| 152:30 | like it's almost inverted at this point |
| 152:32 | because I think at some point during |
| 152:35 | school if a teacher calls on you and you |
| 152:37 | say you don't know you're punished for |
| 152:39 | that and so we have such a repetitive |
| 152:41 | cycle of both having it happen to us and |
| 152:43 | watching people like us have a punishing |
| 152:45 | experience that it's very very hardcore |
| 152:48 | taught to us to never say that that we |
| 152:50 | don't know but that most basic |
| 152:55 | lie trains us over and over again to |
| 152:58 | never say what we actually think and if |
| 153:00 | we don't know then that may be one of |
| 153:04 | the easiest ways to start telling the |
| 153:09 | truth it's kind of the same as the if I |
| 153:12 | can't trust you on know I can't trust |
| 153:14 | you a yes I love it yeah it's the exact |
| 153:17 | same energy |
| 153:23 | not knowing is really powerful |
| 153:26 | because then learning becomes the only |
| 153:31 | clear directive and so if we know what |
| 153:33 | learning is which is same condition new |
| 153:34 | Behavior then it's like what do I need |
| 153:35 | to change about what I do in order to |
| 153:37 | learn this thing it also allows us to |
| 153:39 | say many things are not worth learning |
| 153:41 | because they probably won't affect my |
| 153:42 | life in any way well think how much you |
| 153:45 | pity the person who like it is literally |
| 153:48 | the worst if you imagine a quadrant of |
| 153:49 | no and not knowing and thinking you know |
| 153:52 | and thinking you don't know the worst |
| 153:54 | quadrant to be in is thinking you know |
| 153:57 | whilst not knowing right and that is |
| 153:59 | every single person who isn't prepared |
| 154:03 | to say I don't know yeah and internally |
| 154:06 | doesn't believe it I've already got the |
| 154:07 | answer for that you know they they they |
| 154:09 | are unable to transition across into |
| 154:11 | white belt or beginner mentality they're |
| 154:13 | always in that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah |
| 154:15 | yeah I know about that I know about that |
| 154:17 | I think Mark Twain said it's it's not |
| 154:20 | the things we know that kill us but the |
| 154:21 | things that just that we think we know |
| 154:23 | but just ain't |
| 154:28 | so a lot of self-work can be summarized |
| 154:31 | into thoughts aren't true feelings don't |
| 154:34 | require actions things aren't good or |
| 154:36 | bad they just are our greatest enemy is |
| 154:39 | ignorance to change your life change |
| 154:41 | your surroundings our actions not our |
| 154:43 | pasts Define who we |
| 154:47 | are I think that's pretty much probably |
| 154:49 | 95% of |
| 154:52 | self-work I stand by my |
| 154:54 | statement thoughts aren't true feelings |
| 154:56 | don't require action things aren't good |
| 154:58 | or bad they just are our greatest enemy |
| 155:00 | is ignorance to change your life change |
| 155:02 | your surroundings our actions not our |
| 155:04 | pasts Define who we are man I could |
| 155:06 | unpack all of |
| 155:10 | those so let's start with |
| 155:13 | ignorance |
| 155:15 | so I am not a moralist but if I were a |
| 155:19 | moralist then I would say that ignorance |
| 155:23 | is the only evil and therefore knowledge |
| 155:26 | is the only good and so most atrocities |
| 155:31 | if we Define them that way that humans |
| 155:33 | inflict on one another comes from |
| 155:36 | ignorance we don't know something about |
| 155:38 | the other person or the other party and |
| 155:40 | if we had absolute context on why |
| 155:44 | someone does what they do if we lived |
| 155:46 | their life then we would have absolute |
| 155:48 | knowledge on it and then we would be |
| 155:49 | them |
| 155:50 | and so then we probably wouldn't try to |
| 155:51 | hurt them because we would be them and |
| 155:55 | so I see the pursuit of knowledge and |
| 155:58 | it's corollary how I like it the pursuit |
| 156:00 | of learning changing our Behavior to be |
| 156:03 | my ultimate purpose in life because if I |
| 156:06 | think about myself as going through life |
| 156:07 | then I want to learn as much as I can |
| 156:10 | which is changing my behavior ideally |
| 156:12 | suited to the direction that I want to |
| 156:13 | go in as for the if you want to change |
| 156:17 | your life change your surroundings |
| 156:26 | if we want to behave a certain way then |
| 156:29 | we want to increase the likelihood that |
| 156:32 | a behavior occurs and so BF Skinner said |
| 156:35 | this and I just love this it's like my |
| 156:36 | most Savage quote of his he |
| 156:38 | says people |
| 156:40 | say you can lead a horse to water but |
| 156:43 | you can't make it drink false said if I |
| 156:47 | dehydrate the horse I salt its mouth I |
| 156:49 | put it in the Heat and I put its face |
| 156:52 | one inch away from water I can veritably |
| 156:54 | guarantee that it will |
| 156:56 | drink and I think about that visual all |
| 157:00 | the time when I think about myself as |
| 157:02 | the horse and I think to myself what is |
| 157:06 | the behavior that I want drinking water |
| 157:08 | and what is the salt in my mouth and |
| 157:09 | what is the dehydration the motivation |
| 157:12 | for this behavior that I can create and |
| 157:14 | so I am not a believer in Free Will I |
| 157:18 | believe that |
| 157:20 | we respond to the conditions that we've |
| 157:21 | had and then we learn behaviors as a |
| 157:23 | result of those things and so for |
| 157:25 | example I could get everyone in here the |
| 157:27 | entire crew to get naked guarantee you I |
| 157:29 | could do it all I would do is I just |
| 157:31 | crank up the temperature and I'd wait |
| 157:32 | and eventually everyone would get naked |
| 157:35 | it would happen and so everyone has this |
| 157:36 | idea that they have this free |
| 157:38 | will but that's what would happen |
| 157:41 | eventually and |
| 157:43 | so if that's true then we have |
| 157:46 | significantly less control and at the |
| 157:48 | same time more control of our Behavior |
| 157:51 | if we can stack the deck in our favor |
| 157:53 | and so part of the reason going to bed |
| 157:55 | at 9:00 p.m. is so powerful is because |
| 157:57 | we're changing the conditions so that we |
| 157:58 | can change our Behavior if all of your |
| 158:00 | friends are poor Harvard did that long |
| 158:02 | study and said that the the number one |
| 158:04 | correlate was your reference group which |
| 158:05 | is who you compare yourself to also note |
| 158:08 | not who you spend the most time with |
| 158:09 | it's who you compare yourself to and so |
| 158:11 | if you want to change your life change |
| 158:12 | who you compare yourself to number one |
| 158:15 | but part of who you compare yourself to |
| 158:17 | is who you spend your time with or who |
| 158:18 | at least you can assume the most stuff |
| 158:20 | so if you're doing this then maybe |
| 158:21 | that's a good thing or maybe it's a |
| 158:22 | terrible thing because you're comparing |
| 158:23 | the wrong people but either way if you |
| 158:26 | want to get fit if you get around fitter |
| 158:30 | people you will be deprived of Fitness |
| 158:32 | because you'll be the least in shaped |
| 158:33 | person and then all of a sudden you'll |
| 158:34 | be more motivated if you are poor but |
| 158:38 | you're the richest of your friends or |
| 158:40 | the same level of wealth as your friends |
| 158:41 | then get around people who make more |
| 158:42 | money and then of course people say but |
| 158:45 | I can't get around people who make more |
| 158:47 | money okay |
| 158:50 | no one else has ever done it no one who |
| 158:52 | has had it worse than you has ever |
| 158:54 | figured out how to do it you're |
| 158:56 | right right of course you're not right |
| 158:58 | so shut the [ __ ] |
| 159:00 | up thoughts aren't |
| 159:02 | true oh I mean how many things do we |
| 159:05 | think every day that are just false one |
| 159:08 | they can be factually false but also |
| 159:10 | from the um reactionary perspective I'll |
| 159:15 | give an example so |
| 159:20 | someone miscommunicate and Wrongs me in |
| 159:23 | some way I get angry and think I should |
| 159:26 | wrong them back now that's my first |
| 159:29 | thought if I then |
| 159:31 | say what does that behavior increase the |
| 159:34 | likelihood of occurring as a result what |
| 159:36 | do I want to have happen as a result of |
| 159:38 | my behavior well I want them to |
| 159:42 | apologize or I want them to just not do |
| 159:44 | that again well then me reacting back to |
| 159:47 | them increases the likelihood that they |
| 159:49 | will retaliate and so in doing what my |
| 159:54 | first thought was I increased the |
| 159:56 | likelihood of the negative occurrence |
| 159:57 | that I'm trying to avoid and so thinking |
| 160:01 | through what happens after that thing in |
| 160:04 | inpersonal Dynamics and also from a |
| 160:06 | business decisions perspective has |
| 160:08 | helped me so much like I've had I'll |
| 160:11 | give you an example of one that happened |
| 160:13 | not that long ago somebody reached out |
| 160:15 | to me relatively big account and says |
| 160:17 | hey um can you read my book it would |
| 160:19 | mean the world to me if you left me an |
| 160:21 | endorsement um and I |
| 160:25 | said out of respect for you I won't just |
| 160:29 | ghost this message or or give you a |
| 160:31 | half-hearted answer and then just hope |
| 160:33 | that you forget that I said yes I'm not |
| 160:35 | going to endorse your book but you're |
| 160:38 | welcome to send it to me I will probably |
| 160:40 | just flip through it because I have a |
| 160:42 | lot of other books that I need to read |
| 160:43 | that are more closely related to my goal |
| 160:45 | but I appreciate the flattery that's |
| 160:48 | implied in you ask me to do |
| 160:51 | that before I wrote that message I was |
| 160:54 | like okay what do I want to have happen |
| 160:56 | after I send this message now if I say |
| 161:00 | the go if I just ghost him then I will |
| 161:02 | probably have a null outcome and he'll |
| 161:04 | probably have a slight negative because |
| 161:05 | he'll remember but but he'll be like |
| 161:07 | okay fine that was his way of saying no |
| 161:09 | but if I say if I compliment him thank |
| 161:13 | him for the compliment with me and also |
| 161:14 | tell the truth I'll probably get |
| 161:16 | somebody who in the future will know |
| 161:18 | that my Yes means something when I when |
| 161:19 | I choose to do it and so it's thinking |
| 161:22 | like two steps ahead of what happens |
| 161:24 | after I say this thing back and is how |
| 161:26 | do I increase the likelihood of that |
| 161:27 | second move not the first move and it |
| 161:30 | sounds silly to say because people are |
| 161:32 | like oh of course but like I don't think |
| 161:33 | most people do that and it has helped me |
| 161:37 | so much and even like with interpersonal |
| 161:40 | Dam with with my marriage with Ila if I |
| 161:43 | want Leila |
| 161:47 | to to talk to to me a certain way then |
| 161:51 | if I punish her when she doesn't talk to |
| 161:54 | me that way what she'll really do is |
| 161:56 | she'll avoid talking to me in |
| 161:58 | general and so it's like I have to find |
| 162:00 | a time when she does that thing so that |
| 162:02 | I can immediately reward her so that I |
| 162:03 | can increase the likelihood that it |
| 162:05 | occurs and so I I think about this all |
| 162:07 | the time with most of the Dynamics that |
| 162:09 | we have and so um anyways I'll just stop |
| 162:12 | on that tension but I think uh this is |
| 162:14 | something especially over the last year |
| 162:16 | that |
| 162:17 | I've as a rehabilit |
| 162:20 | people pleaser big people pleaser |
| 162:24 | uh being able to make your needs known |
| 162:27 | being able to make demands uh is a real |
| 162:30 | skill and it's a it's so strange given |
| 162:33 | that pursuing your needs is maybe one of |
| 162:36 | the most fundamental human things that |
| 162:38 | there is but I kind of realized that |
| 162:42 | especially people that you respect in a |
| 162:44 | sort of social dynamics way people don't |
| 162:46 | want to hear what they want to hear they |
| 162:49 | want to hear what you actually think |
| 162:51 | about a thing so so many times someone |
| 162:54 | will ask you opinion what do you think |
| 162:55 | of the Oppenheimer movie what you think |
| 162:58 | they want to hear is whatever they think |
| 163:00 | which is oh wasn't it great did you |
| 163:01 | watch in IMAX yeah I did did you get |
| 163:03 | Sour Patch Kids yeah I did uh but what |
| 163:05 | they actually want to hear if you were |
| 163:06 | to say do you know what it is man like I |
| 163:08 | don't know it was just a little sort of |
| 163:09 | drawn out for me and all of the visual |
| 163:12 | effects felt a little bit more I haven't |
| 163:13 | seen it I don't [ __ ] know |
| 163:15 | but what you think people want to hear |
| 163:18 | is |
| 163:19 | is not what they actually want to hear |
| 163:22 | they want to hear what you think and |
| 163:24 | that requires you to tell the truth and |
| 163:26 | oddly enough that means that telling |
| 163:27 | someone what they don't want to hear |
| 163:30 | ends up with a bigger net positive for |
| 163:32 | you than actually giving them the thing |
| 163:33 | that they wanted for the business owners |
| 163:36 | or for the advertisers in the room or |
| 163:37 | the people who make content by the way |
| 163:39 | this is the ultimate hack is just tell |
| 163:42 | the truth because when you do that you |
| 163:44 | will by definition make very unique |
| 163:47 | content because everyone else is so of |
| 163:49 | thinking or saying what they actually |
| 163:51 | think and so you can stand out without |
| 163:54 | trying to stand out the problem is that |
| 163:56 | the vast majority of people who quote |
| 163:57 | make content or try to quote add value |
| 163:59 | just regurgitate what they think adds |
| 164:02 | value rather than just saying what they |
| 164:04 | really think Al the benefit of |
| 164:05 | experience right because it's the only |
| 164:07 | way that you can stress test whether or |
| 164:08 | not this thing that you're trying to |
| 164:10 | talk about is an actual thing and you |
| 164:13 | also get an extra perspective on that |
| 164:15 | too when you know that this is what most |
| 164:17 | of the people say about a thing I have |
| 164:19 | tried it and this is my perspective on |
| 164:21 | not only the thing but why other people |
| 164:24 | think that this thing is a thing given |
| 164:25 | that I know that it doesn't |
| 164:28 | work feelings don't require action very |
| 164:33 | similar I think this one is super |
| 164:36 | powerful for we'll relate All Phases but |
| 164:39 | especially the beginner so if you're a |
| 164:41 | beginner you have to |
| 164:43 | separate you feeling something and you |
| 164:46 | acting on that feeling because you may |
| 164:48 | feel hopeless many many times but you |
| 164:50 | need to continue to do the activities |
| 164:52 | that are aligned with your goal you may |
| 164:54 | feel hungry but you need to not eat the |
| 164:56 | cookie to stay align with your goal you |
| 164:58 | may feel angry but know that retaliating |
| 165:00 | at your coworker has no likely positive |
| 165:03 | outcome you may hate your boss but |
| 165:06 | undermining them in front of the team |
| 165:08 | may make you feel good in the moment but |
| 165:09 | again destroy your long-term career |
| 165:12 | prospects and so I think creating a gap |
| 165:15 | and so I was talking to one of our CEOs |
| 165:16 | who was having a little bit of stress |
| 165:18 | issue and I said I I want you to think |
| 165:19 | that you're a Yeti can I want you to |
| 165:21 | think you're one of these cans that has |
| 165:23 | a vacuum between both walls I like you |
| 165:25 | got your feelings on one side you've got |
| 165:26 | your internal temperature and you've got |
| 165:28 | your external temperature and I was like |
| 165:29 | I just want you to do this just create |
| 165:32 | space and space within the context of |
| 165:35 | behavior is time which is when I feel |
| 165:39 | something and I have the desire to act |
| 165:41 | on it you can at that moment you have |
| 165:44 | the lowest action threshold which means |
| 165:46 | that you're the highest likely of |
| 165:47 | Behaving or or doing something thing is |
| 165:49 | when you have this feeling and so I want |
| 165:52 | to make as logical of decisions as I |
| 165:54 | possibly can hopefully we're all aligned |
| 165:56 | on the fact that logical decisions in |
| 165:57 | general work out better than illogical |
| 165:59 | decisions and so if we make logical |
| 166:02 | decisions on a regular basis then we'll |
| 166:03 | have longer term outcomes if we want to |
| 166:05 | increase the likelihood that our |
| 166:06 | decisions in general are logical then we |
| 166:08 | want to create space between when we |
| 166:10 | feel and when we do |
| 166:13 | and encapsulated in one sentence |
| 166:16 | it's just because you feel something |
| 166:19 | doesn't mean you need to act on it and |
| 166:21 | if you have an idea that you want to act |
| 166:23 | on because of a feeling if it still |
| 166:25 | feels good in the morning then do it but |
| 166:28 | I've |
| 166:29 | never regretted taking time before |
| 166:32 | acting when I was angry but I sure as |
| 166:35 | hell have regretted almost everything |
| 166:37 | that I've done immediately the moment I |
| 166:39 | felt |
| 166:40 | angry things aren't good or bad they |
| 166:43 | just |
| 166:43 | St oh this is the essence of mosy um I'm |
| 166:49 | not the only one |
| 166:51 | um |
| 166:56 | so I think what makes life more |
| 166:59 | difficult for people is the Judgment |
| 167:02 | they have on themselves about what they |
| 167:04 | believe they're supposed to do or |
| 167:05 | supposed to have achieved or that this |
| 167:09 | condition or this thing that happened is |
| 167:10 | good or bad or it should have been good |
| 167:12 | or it should have been better |
| 167:15 | and the story of the boy with the horse |
| 167:18 | in the village I'll tell it in 30 |
| 167:20 | seconds which |
| 167:21 | is uh dad gets kid a horse and everybody |
| 167:26 | in the village says that's amazing the |
| 167:27 | old man says we'll see and then the kid |
| 167:30 | is riding the horse and he breaks his |
| 167:32 | leg and everyone in this town says oh |
| 167:33 | that's so horrible and the old man says |
| 167:35 | we'll see and then the Army comes to |
| 167:37 | town to take all of the young men to War |
| 167:40 | and the kid can't go because his leg is |
| 167:42 | broken and everyone says that's amazing |
| 167:43 | and the old man says we'll see and the |
| 167:45 | thing is is that as we continue to play |
| 167:47 | out the timeline of life we can't know |
| 167:49 | if anything is good or bad until the day |
| 167:50 | we die and the day we die it won't |
| 167:52 | matter because we'll be dead and so it |
| 167:53 | means that at the end of the day all the |
| 167:55 | things that occur simply |
| 167:57 | occur and for me reminding myself of |
| 168:01 | that that I think this is bad or I think |
| 168:05 | this is good it limits the Peaks and it |
| 168:07 | also Limits The Valleys and saying this |
| 168:10 | just is and I think it's in my opinion |
| 168:12 | absolute acceptance of the world without |
| 168:15 | casting judgment on it and it's |
| 168:16 | difficult to do because we all want to |
| 168:18 | make judgments and we have to make |
| 168:19 | judgments in order to live we have to |
| 168:21 | approximate this is a good decision bad |
| 168:22 | decision this is a decision that will |
| 168:23 | increase the likelihood that what I want |
| 168:24 | to have happen will happen but most of |
| 168:27 | the good bads that we have that are |
| 168:29 | coming up are not for our own benefit |
| 168:31 | are not aligned with our goals they're |
| 168:33 | aligned with one person that told us |
| 168:34 | something when we were seven years old |
| 168:35 | and then we incorporated that and we say |
| 168:36 | oh this is bad because someone else when |
| 168:38 | we were a kid like you hit your head and |
| 168:40 | then you look at the adult and the adult |
| 168:41 | says that's bad and you say oh it's bad |
| 168:43 | I'm going to cry now right and so there |
| 168:45 | are so many thousands and millions of |
| 168:47 | those tiny judgments that are passed on |
| 168:48 | to us that do not serve us and |
| 168:51 | so for me it has been more beneficial to |
| 168:54 | whitewash everything and then actively |
| 168:57 | rebuild what I believe to be good or bad |
| 168:59 | based on those things but with a |
| 169:01 | baseline reality that none of it is it |
| 169:04 | is kind of narcissistic or solipsistic |
| 169:07 | to believe that you know whether a thing |
| 169:09 | is good or bad means you know the |
| 169:11 | future you know what the outcome of this |
| 169:14 | is going to be right there's this story |
| 169:17 | that uh |
| 169:19 | I couldn't believe it was about |
| 169:21 | September 11th so I didn't realize this |
| 169:23 | but the night before September 11th |
| 169:26 | actually had quite bad weather I think |
| 169:29 | and it meant that people getting home |
| 169:31 | from baseball games got home way later |
| 169:34 | and then you'll remember the morning of |
| 169:36 | September 11th it's beautiful blue clear |
| 169:38 | skies so had that Storm been only 12 |
| 169:41 | hours later the whole world would have |
| 169:43 | been different but it wasn't there's |
| 169:45 | this story of a guy who was going for a |
| 169:50 | meeting and I think it was his birthday |
| 169:53 | the lady that he worked with had got him |
| 169:55 | one of these uh illustration ties you |
| 169:58 | sort of gudy hideous thing with drawings |
| 170:00 | all over it and he was wearing a shirt |
| 170:04 | that clashed with it and she gifted him |
| 170:06 | this as they had coffee on the morning |
| 170:09 | of September 11th early downtown |
| 170:12 | Manhattan and she says look your shirt's |
| 170:15 | wrinkled and it really doesn't go with |
| 170:16 | this tie wear the tie it'll make you |
| 170:18 | feel confid it's a nice present for you |
| 170:19 | so he goes back to the hotel she goes to |
| 170:21 | the North Tower she dies he's |
| 170:26 | alive how on Earth are you supposed to |
| 170:29 | say giving that tie was good or bad you |
| 170:33 | have no idea what's going to happen |
| 170:35 | Downstream from the things that are cut |
| 170:37 | so I know this guy who has a podcast and |
| 170:41 | years ago he like Snapped his Achilles |
| 170:43 | and could barely walk and so the crazy |
| 170:46 | thing is is that many people in that |
| 170:48 | time would have been like this is the |
| 170:49 | worst thing that could have possibly |
| 170:51 | happened but because he had snapped his |
| 170:54 | ailles he was like well I have to make |
| 170:56 | the best of us I have to do something I |
| 170:57 | might as well stick with that podcast |
| 170:59 | that I said I was going to start and |
| 171:00 | then years later he became a top 50 |
| 171:03 | podcast in the world and I think an |
| 171:07 | amazing frame is you can make anything |
| 171:10 | that feels circumstantially negative in |
| 171:12 | the moment if you ask the question what |
| 171:14 | would make this thing the best thing |
| 171:16 | ever and so I would argue |
| 171:19 | maybe you would agree that you snapping |
| 171:21 | your Achilles was probably the best |
| 171:23 | thing that ever happened to you because |
| 171:26 | it got you here |
| 171:30 | and right now you probably have your |
| 171:33 | version of The Snap to killes that's |
| 171:34 | going on in your life but there's also |
| 171:37 | the version of the top 50 in the world |
| 171:39 | podcast that is waiting for you to take |
| 171:42 | action as a result of your snapped |
| 171:46 | Achilles I always had this problem with |
| 171:50 | people who |
| 171:51 | said it was meant to |
| 171:54 | be right |
| 171:57 | because |
| 171:59 | retrospectively you're kind of taking |
| 172:01 | your agency out of the situation so for |
| 172:04 | instance me saying I'm so glad that Co |
| 172:07 | happened and shut all of the nightclubs |
| 172:08 | down which forced my business to close |
| 172:10 | so that I could focus on the podcast so |
| 172:11 | that I would restart playing Cricket so |
| 172:13 | that I would snap my achilles so that I |
| 172:14 | would then move to America and then blah |
| 172:16 | blah blah blah blah but I actually think |
| 172:18 | that that's quite a |
| 172:19 | disempowering frame to put around things |
| 172:21 | because he goes it totally takes away |
| 172:23 | the difficulty that you had to overcome |
| 172:25 | you know if you're in a car accident and |
| 172:27 | you break your femur and you say it was |
| 172:30 | meant to be because I met my partner who |
| 172:32 | was the nurse that looked after me while |
| 172:34 | I was being rehab back to health you |
| 172:37 | go okay or on the flip side of that you |
| 172:40 | managed to be sufficiently Charming to |
| 172:42 | get a partner while you had a snapped |
| 172:44 | femur in the |
| 172:46 | hospital that wasn't meant to be that |
| 172:48 | was your agency |
| 172:51 | so retrospectively you want it all to be |
| 172:54 | on you and known and in advance you want |
| 172:58 | it all to be completely up in the air |
| 173:00 | and |
| 173:01 | unknown I think the the high agency |
| 173:03 | frame allows you to break your Achilles |
| 173:05 | and say what will I do to make this |
| 173:07 | amazing and I think that's where that's |
| 173:10 | where the magic happens because then |
| 173:11 | everything serves |
| 173:14 | you our actions not our pasts Define Who |
| 173:17 | We Are |
| 173:34 | victims see their past as their |
| 173:37 | fate Champions see their past as their |
| 173:41 | origin story and so a lot of people are |
| 173:43 | living through their origin story right |
| 173:45 | now or they're living through the very |
| 173:47 | reason that they'll never be successful |
| 173:49 | but it could be the exact same |
| 173:53 | situation and the only difference |
| 173:55 | between either character is the actions |
| 173:58 | they choose to take which means that if |
| 174:00 | you're using Joe Rogan's frame waking up |
| 174:03 | in your main player character today in |
| 174:05 | this |
| 174:07 | moment as weird of a contract as this is |
| 174:09 | the past doesn't |
| 174:11 | exist just gone it's not anywhere and so |
| 174:14 | the only thing that we absolutely have |
| 174:16 | control over is the actions that we take |
| 174:17 | right now |
| 174:18 | and it's a weird eraser of time to when |
| 174:21 | you really start thinking that like it's |
| 174:23 | only exists in chemicals in my brain but |
| 174:25 | it doesn't exist right now to think |
| 174:27 | about the past that way but in some ways |
| 174:28 | it's also very freeing because it means |
| 174:30 | that I get to start with no |
| 174:32 | baggage and in some ways for me it makes |
| 174:35 | the present feel |
| 174:37 | light because you're not carrying |
| 174:39 | anything into it have you seen that Tim |
| 174:41 | Urban illustration of the tree of time |
| 174:45 | these sort of branches so it starts off |
| 174:48 | with life and there's only one Black |
| 174:50 | branch that is the particular path that |
| 174:52 | you took and there's all of these green |
| 174:54 | ones that you haven't taken and then it |
| 174:56 | gets to now there's a line where it's |
| 174:58 | now and then it turns to every branch is |
| 175:00 | potential right so you had lots that |
| 175:03 | could have been only one that was and |
| 175:05 | now you have lots that could be and an |
| 175:08 | unlimited number that may be alt |
| 175:10 | together and that's it is you're right |
| 175:13 | it's light when you think about that |
| 175:15 | frame it makes the present moment feel |
| 175:17 | well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter |
| 175:18 | matter what happened yesterday it |
| 175:19 | doesn't M matter what happened when I |
| 175:21 | was a kid it doesn't |
| 175:23 | matter it only matters if you make it |
| 175:26 | matter so Jean Paul |
| 175:29 | satra someone screenshotted this from a |
| 175:32 | book I have no idea what the buck is but |
| 175:34 | it's a |
| 175:35 | [ __ ] I have led a toothless life |
| 175:39 | a toothless life I have never bitten |
| 175:41 | into anything I was waiting I was |
| 175:44 | reserving myself for later on and I have |
| 175:47 | just noticed that my teeth have |
| 175:59 | gone a lot of people wait for perfect |
| 176:02 | conditions to start but don't realize |
| 176:03 | that starting is the perfect |
| 176:06 | condition |
| 176:10 | and the part of that quote that I like a |
| 176:12 | lot from little |
| 176:16 | French is uh |
| 176:19 | your teeth can get sharper and stronger |
| 176:21 | too so that he's saving himself to use |
| 176:24 | his teeth but he could have had all of |
| 176:26 | his teeth at the end if he had been |
| 176:27 | using them the whole time and so we have |
| 176:30 | this idea I call it the fallacy of the |
| 176:32 | perfect pick but thinking that you're |
| 176:33 | going to have this one shot this one |
| 176:35 | pick of this one opportunity this one |
| 176:39 | podcast this one Whatever that's going |
| 176:42 | to take you all the way but it's the |
| 176:46 | habit of biting that takes you all the |
| 176:49 | way not where you choose to bite the |
| 176:51 | first time |
| 176:53 | and I obviously now have a huge history |
| 176:56 | of this and you do too which is we have |
| 177:00 | learned to just bite and know that our |
| 177:03 | teeth will get stronger and we will |
| 177:05 | learn how to Chomp down along the way |
| 177:13 | and waiting to begin never got anyone |
| 177:20 | anywhere yeah I had I kind of became |
| 177:22 | obsessed with this belief that one day |
| 177:26 | life's duties will be out of the way and |
| 177:28 | then you can finally start doing the |
| 177:30 | thing that you want to do or you're |
| 177:31 | meant to do uh Marie Luis Von France |
| 177:34 | says she calls it the provisional life |
| 177:37 | which I love there is this strange |
| 177:39 | feeling that one is not yet in real life |
| 177:41 | for the time being one is doing this or |
| 177:43 | that but there is always the fantasy |
| 177:45 | that sometime in the future the real |
| 177:47 | thing will come about it's also known as |
| 177:49 | deferred happiness syndrome the common |
| 177:51 | feeling that your life has not yet begun |
| 177:53 | that your present reality is a mere |
| 177:55 | Prelude to some idillic future this idle |
| 177:57 | is a mirage that'll fade as you approach |
| 178:00 | revealing that the Prelude you rushed |
| 178:01 | through was in fact the one to your |
| 178:05 | death there really isn't any other time |
| 178:08 | and the more you know like this is one |
| 178:11 | of the I guess Melancholy realizations |
| 178:13 | of getting older that you actually think |
| 178:16 | oh you know what it is there are things |
| 178:19 | that I can't do now that I could have |
| 178:22 | done before it is going for both of us |
| 178:26 | it is going to get linearly harder to |
| 178:27 | build muscle for the rest of time it's |
| 178:30 | never going to be as easy as it was 10 |
| 178:31 | years ago to build |
| 178:33 | muscle and you go okay well that's an |
| 178:36 | argument for starting sooner and the |
| 178:38 | same thing goes for becoming more |
| 178:39 | psychologically healthy for becoming |
| 178:41 | more balanced for becoming more wealthy |
| 178:44 | for investing in good habits friends oh |
| 178:49 | God Christopher Hitchins it is a |
| 178:50 | Melancholy lesson of older life that you |
| 178:53 | can no longer Make Old |
| 178:56 | Friends like find your people now find |
| 178:59 | your |
| 179:00 | people right now and become friends with |
| 179:03 | them find your habits right now and |
| 179:05 | start doing |
| 179:07 | them yeah it's never been easier to get |
| 179:10 | a muscle than it was 10 years ago it's |
| 179:13 | never been easier to make money than it |
| 179:14 | was 10 years ago but it'll also never be |
| 179:16 | easier than it is right now now it'll |
| 179:19 | only get harder and so that's actually |
| 179:21 | like a pretty strong impetus to do it |
| 179:24 | now it'll literally never get easier |
| 179:27 | Alex hosi ladies and gentlemen dude yeah |
| 179:31 | I appreciate you man these fug State |
| 179:33 | episodes are fun where should people go |

| 179:46 | but it's uh within the next 6 months |
| 179:48 | mons or so um it'll be coming out uh so |
| 179:50 | very excited about that been working on |
| 179:52 | that one for six years um so it's |
| 179:54 | finally finally ready um you finish |
| 179:57 | writing that yeah cool because the last |
| 179:59 | one was a little closer to the W oh yeah |
| 180:02 | this one I so F I'll tell you the story |
| 180:04 | so um I wrote this book first and so um |
| 180:09 | I'll tell you the sub headline which is |
| 180:11 | uh how to make money and I after |
| 180:15 | finishing that book and being like this |
| 180:16 | is my masterpiece I then was like oh no |
| 180:19 | they won't be able to use this unless |
| 180:20 | they know how to advertise because you |
| 180:21 | can't use all of these things about |
| 180:22 | making money until you get someone to |
| 180:24 | know who you are and then I was like oh |
| 180:26 | shoot they won't be able to advertise |
| 180:28 | unless they have something to advertise |
| 180:29 | which is an offer so I ended up writing |
| 180:32 | this book first and then realizing that |
| 180:34 | I had to write offers two books away and |
| 180:37 | actually release that first even though |
| 180:38 | i' had written this other book and then |
| 180:40 | I had to write leads to bridge the gap |
| 180:42 | between offers and this book but this is |
| 180:45 | the book that I've been waiting for |
| 180:47 | everyone to read and consume because I |
| 180:49 | think it will make the most people the |
| 180:51 | most money barut did you have a problem |
| 180:54 | given that your writing ability will |
| 180:56 | have probably improved over the other |
| 180:58 | two bucks have you had to go back and |
| 181:00 | sort of catch it up a little bit oh I |
| 181:02 | rewrote it nine times in the last year |
| 181:04 | fantastic but the first draft was done |
| 181:08 | and so the ninth draft which is now in |
| 181:10 | publication or not in publication but is |
| 181:11 | is a finished product um is now done |
| 181:14 | heck yeah what else anything else um I |
| 181:17 | mean we're we're just we're continuing |
| 181:19 | to invest in portfolio companies if |
| 181:21 | you're a company that's looking to scale |
| 181:22 | you can go to acquisition. comom and if |
| 181:25 | you a beginner just learning figuring |
| 181:27 | out uh how to make your first dollar uh |
| 181:30 | I'm a co-owner of school.com SK |
| 181:33 | l.com uh you can start for free it's a |
| 181:36 | cool setup that we have to help people |
| 181:38 | do it and right now |
| 181:40 | 54.1% of people who start a pay |
| 181:42 | community on school make money so we |
| 181:44 | have put a tremendous amount of effort |
| 181:46 | Sam and I into trying to remove all |
| 181:48 | barriers and all friction for people who |
| 181:50 | are getting started so that they have |
| 181:52 | literally no excuses it's a way better |
| 181:55 | strike rate than only funds yeah I don't |
| 181:58 | know what their what their strike rate |
| 181:59 | is but we've worked really hard um to if |
| 182:02 | you saw the amount of detail I mean |
| 182:04 | maybe you heard some of this from the |
| 182:05 | podcast but the amount of detail that |
| 182:06 | went into like where buttons go and what |
| 182:08 | things we remove was actually a big one |
| 182:11 | was how can we so pair this down so that |
| 182:15 | people don't get overwhelmed because the |
| 182:16 | number one reason people cancel or |
| 182:19 | decide not to do something is overwhelm |
| 182:21 | and so we're like okay how can we funnel |
| 182:24 | action into the clearest possible steps |
| 182:27 | that people go step one step two step |
| 182:29 | three and then all of a sudden they're |
| 182:30 | like oh I this actually worked and so |
| 182:33 | it's been um really cool to uh to see |
| 182:36 | the thousands of people who have you |
| 182:38 | know made their first dollar which is |
| 182:39 | what I make all my content about it to |
| 182:41 | begin with and so it's been uh it's been |
| 182:44 | it's been the ride of my life it's been |
| 182:45 | awesome I can't I appreciate you man |
